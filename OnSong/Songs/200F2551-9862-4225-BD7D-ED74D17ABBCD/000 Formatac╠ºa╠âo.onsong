This <*word is bold> and this isn't
*Or we can make the whole line bold

ITALIC
This can be accomplished with a forward slash character like the following:

/This whole line will be italic.
Or just the word </italic> will be.
EMPHASIZED
You can bold and italicize text with a single exclamation point like this:

!This line will be bold and italic.
Or <!just this phrase> will be.
UNDERLINE†
You can underline text using the underscore character like so:

_Underline the entire line of text...
Or just the <_thing you want> to.
BACKSLANT†
This is similar to italics but in the opposite direction. You can do this using a backslash:

\This line will be backslanted.
Or make it only on <\certain words>.
TEXT COLOR
You can use an ampersand to make the text a color either with a named color, or using HTML color codes. For instance:

&red:This line contains red text.
This <�C6B3:word is a custom color> that's like teal.
HIGHLIGHT COLOR
You can also highlight text using a similar syntax with the greater than sign.

>yellow:This line will be highlighted in yellow
Or I'll have a <>#0000FF33:very light blue Christmas> without you by specifying opacity as the last hexadecimal value.
FONT FAMILY†
You can change the font used by naming it:

$Courier:This line will be in Courier font.
FONT SIZE†
You can also change the size of text. Use a number that is greater or equal to 6 as the size in terms of points. You can also use a number less than 6 to indicate a multiple of the base font size. For instance, "2" would be 200% the size of the base font.

^2:This line is 200% the size of the other lines.
Make <^42:forty-two points> in size.
LINKS†
You can type in a web address or URL into the chart and OnSong will automatically detect it and format it as a link. Links are displayed underlined in the app color and will open within the app in a Safari view or as a video player. You can also add a label to use in place of the URL by following the link with the text in parenthesis:
