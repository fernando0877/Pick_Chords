Bm                                 Bm
  Last night a little dancer, came dancin' to my door
A                                G               Em    D A
 Last night a little angel, Came pumpin cross my floor

Bm                                Bm
  She said "Come on baby, I got a licence for love
A                          G           Em    D  A
   And if it expires, pray help, from above.....  because



Bm
  In the midnight hour, she cried, more, more, more
A                              G            Em  D A
  With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more

Bm
In the midniight hour more, more, more"
A                   G           E      D     A     Bm
With a rebel yell- "more, more, more.. More, more, more



Bm                                    Bm  
   She don't, like slavery, she won't sit, and beg
A                                 G             Em  D A
  But when, I'm tired and lonely, she sees me, to bed

Bm
  What set you free, and brought you, to be me babe
A                                G         Em  D A
   What set you free, I need you hear by me    ....Because
