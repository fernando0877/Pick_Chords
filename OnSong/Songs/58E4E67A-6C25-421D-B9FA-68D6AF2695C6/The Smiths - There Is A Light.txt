    Take me out    tonight
              C#m            
Where there's music and this people 
       C#m             A  E  B
who're young and aliiiiiive

     C#m                     A                      E
uhmm Driving in your car, I never never want to go home
  B               C#m         A    E  B
Because I haven't got one, anymore

C#m             A     E  B
  Take me out tonight
            C#m                                          A    E  B
  Because I want to see people, and I want to see lights

C#m                     A                    E 
Driving in your car, oh please don't drop me home
B                C#m
Because it's not my home, it's their
                           A    E  B // F#m  A  B
and I`m not welcome no more

         E             C#m  A            A7+
And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
B           E                    A                F#m  B
  To die by your side, is such a heaven anyway to die
         E       C#m      A                 A7+
And if a ten ton truck,   kills the both of us
   B      E                    A                         F#m  B
To die by your side, well the pleasure, the privilege is mine

C#m             A    E   B
  Take me out tonight
        C#m                                          A E B
take me anywhere, don't care, don't care, don't care

           C#m
And in the darkened under pass, 
             A                          E    B
I thought Oh God my chance has come at last
            C#m
But then a strange fear, gripped me 
                       A   E   B
and I just couldn't ask

C#m             A    E   B
  Take me out tonight
           C#m                                         A   E  B
oh take me anywhere, don't care, don't care, don't care

     C#m                    A                      E     B
Just driving in your car, I never never want to go home
  B               C#m                                A       E  B  // F#m  A  B
Because I haven't got one,  no no nooo, Iiii haven't got one 

         E             C#m  A            A7+
And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
B           E                    A                F#m  B
  To die by your side, is such a heaven anyway to die
         E       C#m      A                 A7+
And if a ten ton truck,   kills the both of us
   B      E                    A                         F#m  B
To die by your side, well the pleasure, the privilege is mine

C#m                       /
 There is a light, and it never goes out 
A                        E          B
there is a light, and it never goes out
