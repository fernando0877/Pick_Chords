Pain Lies on the Riverside
Live

Am                  Dm
 I, have never taken life
 Yet I, have often paid the price
 And you, you are a victim of this age
 And the guilt, that hangs around your neck
 Has got me locked up in a cage

              F         G             Am
 You've to to learn, to live until no end
               F             G
 But first you must learn to swim
           E7
 All over again, yeh, Because

Am                Dm
Paaain lies on the riverside
hey Yoy will never say goodbye
Pain lies on the riverside

	         E7               F  G  F
So put your feet in the water 
	      E7               F  G  F
Put your head in the water 
	      E7
Put your soul in the water
F             G      Am
Join me for a swim tonight

Am                   Dm
 I've forever always tried
 To stay clean and constantly baaaptized
 I am aware that river's banks are dry
 And to wait for a flood
 Is to wait for life

              F         G             Am
 You've to to learn, to live until no end
                    F         G
 But first you must learn to swim
          E7
 All over again, yeh, Because
