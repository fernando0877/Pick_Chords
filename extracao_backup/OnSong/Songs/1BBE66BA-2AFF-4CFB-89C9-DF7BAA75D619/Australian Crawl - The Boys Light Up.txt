The Boys Light Up
Australian Crawl

Bm                      G
I was heading for my my mountain home,
A                     Bm
Where all the latest names are Jones
Bm                        G           
Where husband works back late at night
A
Hopes are up for trousers down,
With a hostess on, a business flight  
Taxi in a Mercedes drive,I hope that driver's coming out, ali-ive
The garden it is Dorsettive, That lady she's so corsetive
She's got fifteen ways, To lead that boy astra-ay
He thinks he's one and only,But that lovely,She's so lonely
She pumps him full of breakfast,And she sends him on his way
Bm
What a sing song dance,What a per-for-mance
G                      F#                     A
What a cheap tent show, Oh no no no no no... then
(Bm G A Bm)
The boys light up,The boys light up
Bm                           
Excited-dly she opens the drawer, Mother's littles helper,Is coming out for more
Strate-gically positioned,Before the mid-day show
The back is arched, Those lips are parched Repeated blow by blow
Later, at the party, all the MPs rave
'Bout the hummers, she's been giving,And the money that they save
To her it is skin lotion,In promotion to
That flat in Surfer's Paradise,With the ocean view
