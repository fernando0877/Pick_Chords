Crazy 
Seal

Em                     G
  A man decides, after seventy years
        A                       Am7
What he goes there for, Is to unlock the door

Em                              G              A   Am
  While those around him, criti-cize and sleep

Em                             G
   Through a fracture on, that breaking wall
         A                              Am
  I see, you my friend, and touch, your face again

Em                          G           A      Am
  Mira-cles, will happen, n`as we speak

C                         G       D                   A
  up we're never gonna survive, unless, We get a little crazy
C                         G       D                 A
  No we're never gonna survive, unless, We are a little..crazy

Em                              G
  Crazy are the people, walking through my head
             A                       Am
One of, them got a gun, to shoot the other one

Em                            G                  
  And yet together, they were friends at school,
A                 Am
  Get it, get it, get it

Em                                 G
 If all were there, when we first, took the pill
     A                       Am
Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe
