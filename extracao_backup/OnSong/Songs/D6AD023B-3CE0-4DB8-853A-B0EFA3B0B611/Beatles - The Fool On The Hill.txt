/tom D, modula pra Dm, fazer em lenta

D6             Em/D
Day after day alone on a hill
    D6                       
The man with the foolish grin
           Em/D
Is keeping perfectly still,

    Em              A7       
But nobody wants to know him
         D6                  Bm7 
they can see that he's justa fool 
    Em                A7
And he never gives an answer.

        Dm   Bb/D   Dm             Bb/D
But the fool on the hill, sees the sun going down 
        C7                        Dm             Dm7   D6
and the eyes in his head, see the world spinning round

D6               Em/D
Well on the way, head in a cloud, 
    D6                              Em/D
The man of thousand voices, talking perfectly loud,
    Em          A7                D6                  Bm7
But nobody ever hears him, or the sound he appears to make
    Em                A7
And he never seems to notice

        Dm   Bb/D   Dm             Bb/D
But the fool on the hill, sees the sun going down 
        C7                        Dm             Dm7   D6
and the eyes in his head, see the world spinning round (solo)

Em              A7                 D6                    Bm7
Nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do and
    Em                 A7
And he never shows his feelings (refrão)

Em              A7         D6                     Bm7
He never listen to them he knows that they're the fools
Em             A7
    They don't like him  (refrão)
