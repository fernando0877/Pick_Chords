F   C       Dm  /    G        C        Dm
How does it feel, To treat me like you do?
            F    C     Dm
When you've laid your hands upon me
    G       C       Dm 
And told me who you are

  F         C      Dm  /
I thought I was mistaken
  G       C       Dm
I thought I heard your words
  G       C       Dm
Tell me, how do I feel
  G       C       Dm
Tell me now, How do I feel

F         C      Dm
Those who came before me
G             C       Dm
Lived through their vocations
         F      C      Dm
From the past until completion
        G     C       Dm
They'll turn away no more

      F     C       Dm
And I still find it so hard
   G          C       Dm
To say what I need to say
        F          C           Dm
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
         G        C       Dm
Just how I should feel today

F       C           Dm
I see a ship in the harbor
G         C       Dm
I can and shall obey
          F          C       Dm
But if it wasn't for your misfortune
         G        C        Dm
I'd be a heavenly person today

      F         C      Dm
And I thought I was mistaken
      G         C          Dm
And I thought I heard you speak
        F   C    Dm
Tell me how do I feel
        G    C            Dm
Tell me now, how should I feel
 F     C         Dm
Now I stand here waiting

   F         C          Dm
I thought I told you to leave me
        G           C       Dm
While I walked down to the beach
        F   C       Dm
Tell me how does it feel
          G     C     Dm
When your heart grows cold
