In Between Days
The Cure

gaita A, 5s

A           D
Yesterday I got so old, 
I felt old like, I could die

Yesterday I got so old, 
it made me want to cry

Go on, go on, just walk away
Go on, go on, your choice is made
Go on, go on, and disappear
Go on, go on, away from here


      Bm                      E
And I know I was wrong, when I said it was true
That it couldn't be me, and be her in between, 
  A         D
without you... Without you


A           D
Yesterday I got so scared, 
I shivered , like a child

Yesterday away from you 
it froze me , deep inside

Come back, come back...don't walk away
Come back, come back...come back today
Come back, come back...why can't you see
Come back, come back...come back to me
