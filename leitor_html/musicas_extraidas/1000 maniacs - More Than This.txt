There was no way of knowing
        Gb           B
Fallen leaves in the night
        Abm               Db
Who can say where they're blowing

   Gb      B
As free as the wind
Abm       Db
Hopefully learning
        Gb     B
Why the sea on the tide
    Abm       Db     /  /  /
Has no way of turning

        Gb     B
Why the sea on the tide
    Abm       Db
Has no way of turning
