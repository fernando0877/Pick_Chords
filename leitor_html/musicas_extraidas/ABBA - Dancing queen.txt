You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life.

Oh, see that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the dancing queen

A                                D/A
Friday night and the lights are low
A                          F#m7
Looking out for a place to go
E                         E4    E              E4
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
                     F#m7  
You've  come to look for a king

A                     D/A
Anybody could be that guy
A                              F#m7
Night is young and the music's high
E                  
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine,
              F#m                            Bm7            E
You're in the mood for a dance. And when you get the chance

E           A              D/A                 A          D/A
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
A              D/A                    A          E/G#  F#m
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, Oh    yeah

E              C#7            F#m7                    B/D#
You can dance, you can jive,  having the time of your life
    D              Bm7                           A         D/A
Oh, see that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the dancing queen

A                       D/A
You're a tease, you turn 'em on.
A                                 F#m7
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
E                  
Looking out for another, anyone will do,
              F#m                             Bm7           E
You're in the mood for a dance.  And when you get the chance
