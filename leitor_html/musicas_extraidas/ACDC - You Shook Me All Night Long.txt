Você Me Sacudiu a Noite Toda
You Shook Me All Night Long

Ela era uma máquina veloz, ela mantinha o seu motor limpo
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean

Ela era a melhor mulher que eu já tinha visto, porra
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen

Ela tinha olhos sinceros, não me dizia mentiras
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies

Me derrubou com aquelas coxas americanas
Knocking me out with those American thighs


Levando mais do que sua parte, me fez lutar por ar
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air

Ela me disse pra vir, mas eu já estava lá
She told me to come, but I was already there

Porque as paredes começaram a balançar, a Terra estava tremendo
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking

Minha cabeça estava doendo e nós estávamos fazendo amor
My mind was aching and we were making it


E você
And you

Me sacudiu a noite toda
Shook me all night long

Sim, você
Yeah, you

Me sacudiu a noite toda
Shook me all night long


Trabalhando dobrado na linha da sedução
Working double-time on the seduction line

Ela é única, ela é só minha, toda minha
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine, all mine

Ela não queria aplausos, apenas fazer outra vez
Wanted no applause, just another course

Ela me transformou em uma refeição e ainda voltou querendo mais
Made a meal outta me and come back for more


Tive que me refrescar para aceitar outra rodada
Had to cool me down to take another round

Agora eu voltei ao ringue para receber outro golpe
Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing

Porque as paredes balançavam, a Terra estava tremendo
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking

Minha cabeça estava doendo e nós estávamos fazendo amor
My mind was aching and we were making it
