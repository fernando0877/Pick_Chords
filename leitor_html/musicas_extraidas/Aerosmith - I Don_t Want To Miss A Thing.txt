I Don't Want To Miss A Thing
Aerosmith

          D6        D6/C#             D6/B
I could stay awake, just to hear you breathing
            D6/G                D6/F#
Watch you smile, while you are sleeping
              D6/E
While you're far away and dreaming

          D6          D6/C#             D6/B
I could spend my life, in this sweet surrender
        D6/G               D6/F#       D6/E
I could stay, lost in this moment,   forever
/              D6/F#     D6/G
Every moment spent with, you
                 A
 Is a moment of treasure

D               A9/C#
  Don't wanna close my eyes
Em7(9)               /
       I don't wanna fall asleep
           G
'Cause I'd miss you baby
      A4                 D
And I don't wanna miss a thing

       /              A9/C#
'Cause even when I dream of you
Em7(9)
       The sweetest dream would never do

I'd still  miss you baby
       A4                D
And I don't wanna miss a thing
( A9/C#  Em7(9) )

         D
Laying close to you
 A9/C#              Bm7(11)
Feeling your heart beating
         G                      D9/F#
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
          Em7
Wondering if it's me you're seeing

        D
Then I kiss your eyes
      A9/C#            Bm7(11)
And thank God we're together
                     F#m7(11) G7M
