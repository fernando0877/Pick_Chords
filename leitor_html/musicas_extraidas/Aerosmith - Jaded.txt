G7+     C7+ (4x)

G                                                        
Hey, j-j-jaded, you've got your mama's style
           Cadd9                G
But you’re yesterday's child to me
G                                                
So jaded, you think that's where it's at 
       Cadd9                       Am
But is that where it's supposed to be
       C                   Am     C
You're gettin' it all over me,  X-rated

G G/F# Em  Bm D
My my baby blue, yeah, I've been thinkin' ‘bout you
G G/F# Em  Bm D                  C          
My my baby blue, yeah, you're so jaded, 
    Am
And I'm the one that jaded you
G  Cadd9 (2x)

G                                           
Hey, j-j-jaded, in all it's misery
        Cadd9            G
It will always be what I love and hated
G                            Cadd9                     Am
And maybe take a ride to the other side we're thinkin' of
      C                    Am            C
We'll slip into the velvet glove, and be jaded

G G/F# Em  Bm D
My my baby blue,  yeah, I've been thinkin' ‘bout you
G G/F# Em  Bm D               C      Am     
My my baby blue, yeah, I'm so jaded, baby, I’m afraid of you

G  Cadd9 (2x)
D                        C     D                      Am
Your thinking's so complicated, I've had it all up to here
D               C               Bb                
But it's so overrated, love and hate it 
         A         G#             G  Cadd9 (4x)
Wouldn't trade it, love me jaded

G                                                   
Hey j-j-jaded, there ain't no baby please 
         Cadd9                     Am
When I'm shooting the breeze, with her
     C                       Am        
When everything you see is a blur, 
    C                        Am
And ecstasy's what you plead for

G G/F# Em  Bm D
My my baby blue,  I have been talkin’ ‘bout you
G G/F# Em  Bm D
My my baby blue, yeah, I've been thinkin' ‘bout you !
G G/F# Em  Bm D
My my baby blue,(my baby blue)
             C      Em    C      Em
Yeah, I’m so jaded, baby, jaded, baby
          C          Am
you're so jaded, and I'm the one that jaded you

G Cadd9 (3x) G
