Pink, it's my new obsession
G          F           C       D    
Pink, it's not even a question, 
G            F             C     D
Pink, on the lips of your lover, 
          G            F          C      D
Ah-'cause Pink is the love you discover 

G            F            C      D
Pink as the bing on your cherry 
G            F       C    D
Pink, 'cause you are so very 
G             F        C       D
Pink, it's the color of passion 
      G               F              C       D
'Cause today it just goes with the fashion 

G           F              C   D
Pink it was love at first sight 
G           F             C      D
Pink, when I turn out the light, and
G            F          C   D 
Pink, gets me high as a kite 
      Em                   A                  F
And I think everything, is going to be all right
                           G
No matter what we do tonight

G      F          C      D
You could be my flamingo 
G        F                 C    D
'Coz pink is the new kinda lingo 
G         F         C     D
Pink like a deco umbrella 
G            F                 C        D
It's kink - but you don't, ever tell her 

G           F              C    D 
Pink it was love at first sight, and 
G          F               C   D
Pink when I turn out the light 
G            F          C     D
Pink gets me high as a kite 
      Em                 A                  F
And I think everything is going to be all right

I, want to be your lover 
G        F           C     D
I wanna wrap you in rubber 
  G             F             C      D
As pink as the sheets, that we lay on 
G             F         C     D
Pink it's my favorite crayon, yeah

Pink, it's like red but not quite

And I think everything is going, to be, all right

No matter what we do tonight
