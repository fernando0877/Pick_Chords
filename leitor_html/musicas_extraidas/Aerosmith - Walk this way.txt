         Backstroke lover always hidin’ ‘neath the cover,
         Still I talked to your daddy he say,
         He said you ain’t seen nothing
         ‘Til you’re down on a muffin,
          Then you’re sure to be a-changin’ your ways.
          I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder,
          All the times I can reminisce,
          ‘Cause the best thing lovin’
           With her sister and her cousin
           Only started with a little kiss, like this!

           See-saw swingin’ with the boys in the school
           And your feet flyin’ up in the air,
           So I took a big chance at the high school dance 
           With a missy who was ready to play
           Was it me she was foolin’
           ‘Cause she knew what she was doin’
           And I know love was here to stay
           When she told me to

          School girl Sadie with the classy, Kinda sassy,
          Little skirt climbing way up her knees,
          There was three young ladies in the ground gym locker
          When I noticed they was lookin’ at me.
          I was a high school loser
          Never made it with a lady
          Till the boys told me something I missed,
          Then my next door neighbour
          With a daughter had a favour,

          So I gave her just a little kiss, like this

          see-saw swingin’ with the boys in the school,
          And your feet flyin’ up in the air,
          Singin’ hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle,


          You be swingin’ like you just didn’t care.
          So I took a big chance at the high school dance
          With a missy who was ready to play.
          Was it me she was foolin’,
          ‘Cause she knew what she was doin’,
          When she told me how to walk this way. 
          She told me to
