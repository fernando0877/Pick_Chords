  The way my broken heart is hurting me
D             G           F#          Bm
  I've got my pride and I know how to hide
                    G
  All my sorrow and pain
A                          Bm
  I'll do my crying in the rain

D      G         A       D
  If I wait for stormy skies
D                G              A          D
  wont know, the rain from the tears in my eyes

only heartaches remain
A                          Bm

G                   Em
  Raindrops falling heaven

Could never, take away my misery
Bm
Since we're not together
     G
I'll pray for stormy weather
   A
To hide these tears, I hope you'll never see

D     G            A        D
  Someday, when my crying's done
D            G                A           D
  I'm gonna wear, a smile and walk in the sun
D            G          F#              Bm
  I may be a fool, but still then darlin you
                      G
will never see me complain
A                          Bm
  I'll do my crying in the rain.
