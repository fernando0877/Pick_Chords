/Capo 1, tom orig F, forma E

E         F         E          F     E
    Know me, Broken by my master     
        F            E             F
Teach thee on child, Love here after

Am               F
Into the flood again
                 Am       F
Same old trip it was, back then
Am                 F
So I made a big mistake 
              Am       F
Try to see it once my wa-a-aay

E        F            E         F   E
    Drifting body its, Sole desertion
   F             E              F
Flying, not yet, Quite the notion

Am               F
Into the flood again
                      Am    F
Same old trip it was, back then
Am                      F
So I made a big mistake 
              Am         F  (E F) (4x)
Try to see it once my wa-a-aay

C         F#   F              Dm              
   Am I wrong? Have I run too far to get home? 
C         F#   F              Dm
   Have I gone? Left you here alone (2x)

If... I... would... could... you
