Back to Black
Amy Winehouse

Dm                      Gm  
   He left no time to regret
     Bb                          A7
Kept his dick wet, with his same old safe, bet

Dm            Gm  
Meeee, and my head high
       Bb                           A7
And my tears dry, get on without my guy

Dm                         Gm  
You went back, to what you knew
   Bb                               A7
So far removed from all that we went through

   Dm                    Gm  
And I, I tread a troubled track
        Bb                    A7
My odds are stacked, I`ll go back to black

Dm                           Gm  
   We only said goodbye with words
                      Bb            
I died a hundred times, You go back to her
   A7
And I go back to.. i go to

Dm         Gm              Bb
I love you much, Its not enough, 
                          A7
you love blow, and I love puff
    Dm              Gm  
And life, is like a pipe
              Bb                            A7
And Im a tiny penny, rolling up the walls inside
