         E7+                                             F#m7
Well sometimes I go out by myself, and I look across the water
       E7+  
And I think of all the things, what you're doing 
                        F#m7
and in my head I make a picture

      A7+                           G#m
'cos since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
         A7+                              G#m
And I've missed your ginger hair, and the way you like to dress
A7+                      G#m                       B
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool, out of me
                        
Why won't you come on over, 

E7+       F#m7
Valerie? Valerie? (2x)

        E7+                                      
Did you have, to go to jail, put your house up for sale,
                   F#m7
did you get a good lawyer?
           E7+  
I hope you didn't catch a tan
                                               F#m7
I hope you find the right man, who'll fix it up for ya ooooo

        E7+  
Are you shoppin, anywhere,
            E7+                              F#m7
changed the colour, of your hair, and are you busy?
         E7+                                    F#m7
And did you have to pay the fine
         E7+                            F#m7
you were dodging all the time are you still dizzy

chorus:

         E7+                                             F#m7
Well sometimes I go out by myself, and I look across the water
      E7+  
And I think of all the things,
                                            F#m7
what you're doing, and in my head, I make a picture

chorus:
