Learning how to recompose the words

Let time just fly

Joyfull sea-gulls roaming on the shore

Not a single note will sound

A lodger      of lunacy

   So lucid   in the jungle

  A scarecrow's agonyzing smile

Oh! My chest will now explode

Falling into pieces
 E                 A
Rain breaks on the ground
  C#m    E
Blood
C#m                    E
    One minute forever
C#m                    E
    A sinner regreting
Am                  G    F  G  Am  G
   My vulgar misery ends

Ride the winds of a brand new day

Found my hope and pride again
