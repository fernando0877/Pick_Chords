Em7               Am7
     The moment I wake uuup,
C             C/D   G7+  
 Before I put on my make-up,
  C                         B7
I say a little prayer for youuuhuu

Em7                   Am7
     while combing my hair, now,
C                   C/D      G7+  
 And wondering what dress to wear, now
  C                       B7
I say a little prayer for you

   C        D7           Bm7        Em7        /  D7    G       /
Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart, And I, will, love you,
   C        D7       Bm7        Em7      /    D7    G        /
Forever and ever, we never will part, Oh how, I'll, love you,
  C         D7             Bm7         Em7    /    D7  G      /
Together, together, that's how it must be, To live without you
      C        D7              B7
Would only be, heart-break for meeeee

Em7              Am7
