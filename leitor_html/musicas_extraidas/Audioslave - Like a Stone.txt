Em  D  Bm7 C

     Em      D             Bm7             C
On a cobweb, afternoon, In a room full of, emptiness
     Em       D            Bm7               C
By a freeway, I confess, I was, lost in the, pages

Em         D              Bm7                C
Of a book, full of death, Reading how we'll, die alone
    Em                   D            Bm7          C
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest, Anywhere we, want to go

Em    Em/F#   G        D/F#      Em
Iiin, yooour  house, I looong to be
Em      Em/F#  G      D/F#     Em
Roooom, byyyyy rooom, paaatien-tly
     C             Em     D/F#    Em
I'll wait, for you there, like a stone
      C            Em     B7   B7  (itro)
I'll wait, for you there alone

      Em         D               Bm7               C
On my death bed, I will pray, To the gods and the, angels
       Em        D           Bm7               C
Like a pagan, to anyone, Who will, take me to, Heaven
Em          D         Bm7             C
To a place, I recall, I was there, so long ago
     Em                  D                  Bm7               C
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, And there you led me, ooon

refrão:

Em  Em/F#  G  D/F#  Em (2x)
C  Em  D/F#  Em  C  Em  B7

    C       G       B7                 C
And ooon, I read, Until the daaay, was gone
      Cm7       A        B7                      Em
And I sat, in regret, Of all the things, Iiii've done

    C              G            B7             C
For all, that I've blessed, And all, that I've wronged
   Cm7              A             B7
In dreams, until my death, I will wander on
