Runaway
Aurora

Em                      D
 I was listening to the ocean
Em                  D
I saw a face in the sand
           C
But when I picked it up
         G         D          C
Then it vanished away from my hands

Em                  D
I had a dream I was seven
Em                   D
Climbing my way in a tree
        C
I saw a piece of heaven
G          D          C       /
Waiting impatient for me, and iiiiii

    Am
And I was running far away
      C
Would I run off the world someday?
G             D
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Am
I was dancing in the rain
   C                        G
I felt alive and I can't complain

G
But now take me home
D                   Cmaj7
Take me home where I belong
        D          Am /
I can't take it anymoooore

Em               D
I was painting a picture
Em                              D
  The picture was a painting of you and
      C                         G
For a moment I thought you were here
           D              C         /
But then again, it wasn't true, and all

    Em                        D
And all this time I have been lying
    Em                    D
Oh, lying in secret to myself
        C                       G            D
I've been putting sorrow on the farrest place
        C
On my shelf, da di daaa

    Am
And I was running far away
      C
Would I run off the world someday?
G                D
Nobody knows, nobody knows
   Am
And I was dancing in the rain
   C                         G
I felt alive and I can't complain

G
But now take me home
D                   Cmaj7
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go

G
Now take me home
D                   Cmaj7
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go

G
Now take me home
D                   Cmaj7
Take me home where I belong
                    Am
I can't take it anymore

          Am
But I kept running
                    C
For a soft place to fall
           G
And I kept running
                    D
For a soft place to fall

          Am
And I kept running
                    C
For a soft place to fall
          G
And I kept running
                    D
For a soft place to fall

    Am
And I was running far away
      C
Would I run off the world someday?

G
But now take me home
D                   Cmaj7
Take me home where I belong
I got no other place to go

G
