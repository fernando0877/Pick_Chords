The Thrill Is Gone
B.B. King

    Bm
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone away
    Em                                Bm
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone away
 Gmaj7             F#7                      Bm
You done me wrong baby And you're gonna be sorry someday

     Bm
The thrill is gone, it's gone away from me
    Em                                Bm
The thrill is gone, the thrill has gone away from me
 Gmaj7                 F#7           Bm
Although I’ll still live on, But so lonely I'll be

     Bm
The thrill is gone, it's gone away for good
       Em                                       Bm
Oh, the thrill is gone, baby it's gone away for good
 Gmaj7                       F#7                    Bm
Someday I know I'll be open armed baby, just like I know a good man should

             Bm
You know I’m free, free now baby, I’m free from your spell
Em                                 Bm
Oh, I’m free, free, free, now, I’m free from your spell
    Gmaj7                F#7          Bm
And now that it’s all over, all I can do is wish you well
