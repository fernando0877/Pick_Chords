C                           Em
Ahh Look at all the lonely people (2x)

Em
Eleanor Rigby, Picks up the rice, In a church, 
                    C               
Where a wedding has been, Lives in a dream
Em
Waits at the window, Wearing the face, that she keeps,
                 C              
In a jar, by the door, Who is it for

Em7            Em6           Em5+              Em
All the lonely people, Where do, they all come from
Em7            Em6           Em5+         Em
All the lonely people, Where do, they all belong?

Em
Father McKenzie, Writing the words, Of a sermon
                  C                  Em
That no, one will hear, No one comes near
 Em
Look at him working, Darning his socks, In the night, 
                    C                  
When there's nobody there, What does he care

Em7            Em6           Em5+              Em
All the lonely people, Where do, they all come from
Em7            Em6           Em5+         Em
All the lonely people, Where do, they all belong?

C                           Em
Ahh Look at all the lonely people (2x)

Em
Eleanor Rigby, Died in the church, And was buried
                C           
Along, with her name, Nobody came
Em
Father McKenzie, Wiping the dirt, from his hands
                      C                
As he walks, from the grave, No one was saved,
