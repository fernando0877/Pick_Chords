She's not a girl, who misses much
Am7              Am6   Em9      Em
  Du du du du du du       ...Oh yeah

Dm                                  Dm
   She's well acquainted, with the touch,
                                        Am
of the velvet hand, like a lizard, on a window pane
    Dm                         Dm                            Am
The man in the crowd, with the multicoloured mirrors, on his hobnail boots
Dm                                                      Am
Lying with his eyes, while his hands, are busy, working overtime
Dm                           Dm               
   A soap impression, of his wife, which he ate,
