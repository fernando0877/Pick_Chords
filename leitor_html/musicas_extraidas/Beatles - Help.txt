A
Help!

A                            C#m               F#m
When I was younger, so much younger than today,
                          D       G   A
I never needed anybody's help in any way.
                                C#m                 F#m
But now those days are gone I'm not so self-assured,
                                        D    G       A
Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the door.

 Bm                                 Bm/A    G                            G/F#
Help me if you can I'm feeling down, and I do appreciate you being 'round.
 E                                                  A
Help me get my feet back on the ground, won't you please please help me.

                              C#m                   F#m
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
                           D     G       A
My independence seemed to vanish in the haze.
                         C#m                 F#m
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
                                        D    G     A
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.

 Bm                                 Bm/A    G                            G/F#
Help me if you can I'm feeling down, and I do appreciate you being 'round.
