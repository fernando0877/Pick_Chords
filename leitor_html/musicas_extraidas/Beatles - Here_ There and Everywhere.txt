(modulação pra 2 5 1 de Em)
       F#m7        B7    F#m7   B7
with a wave of her hand, Nobody can,
  Em              Am        Am7   D7
deny that there's something there.

G     Am7 Bm          C                G    Am7
There,    running my hands through her hair
Bm           C           F#m7        B7
Both of us thinking, how good it can be
F#m7         B7          Em          Am        Am7   D7
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there.

---(modula pra Bb ou Gm)--------

   F7      Bb         Gm
I want her everywhere
       Cm              D7             Gm  (riff)
And if she's beside me I know, I need never care.
Cm               D7            
But to love her, is to need her 


G       Am7 Bm           C            G   Am7
everywhere, Knowing that love is to share,
Bm           C          F#m7        B7
Each one believing that love never dies
F#m7         B7        Em         Am      Am7   D7
Watching her eyes, and hoping I'm always there

           G    Am     Bm     C
I will be there,   and everywhere.
G     Am7        Bm     C    G
Here, there, and everywhere.
