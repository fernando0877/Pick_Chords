I'm A Loser
Beatles

      Am    D  
I'm a loooooser (2x)
        Am             F7M     D
And I'm not, what I, appear to be

G              D            F           G
    Of all the love, I have won or have lost
G              D              F          G
  There is one love, I should never have crossed
G           D         F          G
  She was a girl in a million my friend
G               D                F          G
  I should have known, she would win in the end

      Am    D            Am                D
I'm a loooooser, and I lost someone who's, near to me
      G     Em           Am            F7M     D
I'm a loooooser, and I'm not what I appear to be

G              D           F             G
  Although I laugh and I act like a clown
G              D           F             G
  Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
G              D           F             G
  My tears are falling like rain from the sky
G              D           F             G
  Is it for her or myself that I cry

      Am    D            Am                D
I'm a loooooser, and I lost someone who's, near to me
      G     Em           Am            F7M     D
I'm a loooooser, and I'm not what I appear to be

       G  D   F  G

G              D           F             G
  What I have done to deserve such a fate
G              D           F             G
  I realize I have left it too late
G              D           F             G
  And so it's true pride comes before a fall
G              D           F             G
  I'm telling you so that you won't lose all
