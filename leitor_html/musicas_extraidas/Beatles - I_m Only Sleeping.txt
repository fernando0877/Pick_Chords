I'm Only Sleeping
Beatles

Em                          Am       
When I wake up early in the morning, 
G         C   G         B7
lift my head, I'm still yawning
Em                          Am    
When I'm in the middle of a dream, 
 G       C        G        C
stay in bed, and float up stream (float up stream)

G                    Am                  
Please don't wake me, no don't shake me, 
Bm              Am            Cmaj7/G
leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping

Em                           Am    
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy,
G       C       G             B7
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Em                           Am    
Running everywhere at such a speed,

  G       C     G          C
'til they find, there's no need
G                    Am   
Please don't spoil my day,
           Bm             Am             C7+/G
I'm miles away, and after all I'm only sleeping

Dm7                   E           E7    Am   Am7 Am   F
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window,       taking my time
E                              Am      
Lying there and staring at the ceiling,
G       C      G     B7
Waiting for a sleepy feeling

G                    Am   
Please don't spoil my day,
           Bm             Am             C7+/G
I'm miles away, and after all I'm only sleeping

G                     Am                 
Please don't wake me, no don't shake me,
Bm              Am            C7+/G
leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping.
