In my life 
Beatles

  A             E
          A      E      F#m   A7/G
There are places I'll remember
       D Dm        A
All my life though some have changed
        A    E       F#m    A7/G
Some forever not for better
          D Dm     A
Some have gone and some remain

          F#m               D
All these places have their moments
     G                    A
With lovers and friends I still can recall
         F#m               B
Some are dead and some are living
   Dm           A
In my life I've loved them all

       A         E           F#m    A7/G
But of all these friends and lovers
         D  Dm     A
There is no one compares with you
          A        E          F#m    A7/G
And these memories lose their meaning
       D        Dm      A
When I think of love as something new

         F#m                    D
Though I know I'll never lose affection
    G                      A
For people and things that went before
  F#m                             B
I know I'll often stop and think about them
   Dm        A
In my life I love you more
| A   E   | F#m A7/G | D   Dm  | A       |

         F#m                    D
Though I know I'll never lose affection
    G                      A
For people and things that went before
  F#m                             B
I know I'll often stop and think about them
   Dm        A
In my life I love you more

   Dm
In my life ... I love you more
  A             E          E7       A
