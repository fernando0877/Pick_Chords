       C               G
When I find myself, in times of trouble
 Am    Am7/G  F           
Mother Mary comes to me
  C               G              F  C  C9  C
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

    C              G
And in my hour, of darkness
        Am      Am7/G     F        
She is standing right, in front of me
 C                G              F  C  C9  C
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

       Am         C/G         F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
                  G              F  C  C9  C
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

      C              G
And when the broken-hearted people
 Am      Am7/G  F   
Living in, the world agree
  C               G               F  C  C9  C
There will be, an answer, let it be

      C                  G
For though they may, be parted
         Am      Am7/G        F           
There is still a chance, that they will see
C                 G               F  C  C9  C
There will be, an answer, let it beb (refr√£o)

      C                  G
And when the night, is cloudy
          Am          Am7/G  F          
There is still a light, that shines on me
 C            G              F  C  C9  C
Shine until tomorrow, let it be

   C              G
I wake up to, the sound of music
Am   Am7/G  F          
Mother Mary comes to me
  C               G              F  C  C9  C
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
