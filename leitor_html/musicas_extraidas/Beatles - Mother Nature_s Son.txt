Mother Natureâ€™s Son
Beatles

D      D4         D4      D   /Bm     /A       E/G#  /E  
Born a poor young country boy, Mother Nature's son
A   A4  A     /           A4                      D Dm7 D4 D
All day long, I'm sitting, singing songs for everyone

D     D4     D9        D     /Bm      /A     /G#
Sit beside a mountain stream, See her waters rise
A      A4      A               A4           D Dm7 D4 D
Listen to, the pretty sound of music, as she flies
      
Do do do do do do do do do do do 

D        D4    D4       D      /Bm    /A       /G#  
Find me, in my field of grass, Mother Nature's son
A          A4    A           A4               D Dm7 D4 D
Swaying daisies, sing a lazy song beneath the sun

Oh    Mother Nature's Son
