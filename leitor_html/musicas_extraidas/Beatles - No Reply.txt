This happened once before, When I came to your door, no reply. 
                    F                       G              C
They said it wasn't you, But I saw you peep through your window, 
          Am  Em           Fmaj7      Em
I saw the light, I saw the light, 
                    F                       G        C
I know that you saw me, 'Cos I looked up to see your face. 

               F                                  G              C
I tried to telephone, They said that you were not home, that's a lie, 
                         F                    G        C
'Cos I know where you've been, I saw you walk in, your door, 
         Am Em          Fmaj7      Em
I nearly died, I nearly died, 
Em                F                         G         C
 'Cos you walked hand in hand With another man in my place. 

          C           E        A
If I were you I'd realize that I 
         Dm        F         C
Love you more than any other guy, 
            C        E         A
And I'll forgive the lies that I 
      Dm              F            C
Heard before when you gave me no reply. 

                  F                             G              C
