Norwegian wood
Beatles

gaita G, 4a... no Dm
D
I once had a girl, Or should I say, She once had me
She showed me her room, Isn't it good? Norwegian wood

Dm                   
She asked me to stay
                          G
and she told me to sit anywhere
Dm                              
So I looked around and I noticed
               Em7   A7
there wasn't a chair

D
I sat on a rug, Biding my time, Drinking her wine
We talked until two, And then she said, It's time for bed

Dm                                   
She told me she worked in the morning
               G
and started to laugh
Dm                                  
I told her I didn't and crawled off
                Em7   A7
to sleep in the bath

D
And when I awoke, I was alone, This bird has flown
So I lit a fire, Isn't it good? Norwegian wood
