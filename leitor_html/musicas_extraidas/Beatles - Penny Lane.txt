Penny Lane
Beatles

      B               G#m7           C#m7    F#7
Penny lane there is a barber showing photographs
         B                  G#m7        Bm7
Of every head, he's had the pleasure to know
            G#m7(b5)             G7+
And all the people that come and go
          F#4(7)  F#7 
Stop and say hello

       B           G#m7           C#m7    F#7
On the corner is a banker with a motor car
           B                  G#m7           Bm7
The little children, laugh at him, behind his back
        G#m7(b5)               G7+
And the banker never wears a mac
       F#sus4        E
In the pouring rain, very strange

       A            C#m7            D     %
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A                C#m7            D
 Wet beneath the blue suburban skies
            F#7
I sit and meanwhile back

         B               G#m7            C#m7    F#7
In penny lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
           B           G#m7            Bm7
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
            G#m7(b5)               G7+
He likes to keep,  his fire engine clean
        F#4(7)   F#7 (solo sobre verso)
It's a clean machine

       A            C#m7            D     %
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A          C#m7            D
  Full of fish and finger pies
           F#7
In summer meanwhile back

           B              G#m7          C#m7     F#7
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
            B               G#m7           Bm7
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
               G#m7(b5)                 G7+
And though she feels,  as if she's in a play
       F#4(7)  F#7
She is anyway

      B               G#m7           C#m7    F#7
Penny lane the barber shaves another customer
           B               G#m7          Bm7
We see the banker, sitting waiting for a trim
             G#m7(b5)        G7+
And then the fireman, rushes in
         F#4(7)  F#7       E
From the pouring rain     very strange

       A            C#m7            D     %
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A          C#m7            D
There beneath the blue suburban skies
            F#7
I sit and meanwhile back

       B            D#m7             E
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
  B               B/D#           E     E/B
There beneath the blue suburban skies

           B
Penny lane!
