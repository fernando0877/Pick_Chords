G7            /                   C                             
  One day his woman ran off, with another guy
 G/B                    Am7
 Hit young Rocky in the eeeye
        /                         D                    /
 Rocky didn't like that: He said "Im gonna get that boy'
                          G                      
So one day he walked into town 
 /                         C            /B        
Booked himself a room in a local saloon

Am7         /         D         / 
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
G7        /           C     G/B
Only to find Gideon's bible
Am7        /     D                  
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
G7                            C   G/B
To shoot off the legs of his rival
       
--His rival it seems, had broken his dreams 
  By stealing the girl of his fancy
--Her name was Magil, and she called herself Lil 
  But everyone knew her as Nancy
--Now she and her man, who called himself Dan 
  Were in the next room at the home down
--Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin 
  He said "Danny boy this is a showdown
--But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot 
  And Rocky collapsed in the corner

Duuu dududuru

--The doctor came in, stinking of gin 
  And proceeded to lie on the table
--He said "Rocky you met your match" 
  Rocky said, "Doc it's only a scratch
  I'll be better, I'll be better 
  Doc as soon as I am able
--Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room 
  Only to find Gideon's bible
--Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt 
  To help with good Rocky's revival
