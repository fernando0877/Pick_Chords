She Came In Through The Bathroom Window
Beatles

A                                 D
 She came in through the bathroom window
A                       D
 Protected by a silver spoon
A                                D
 But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
        D                        A
 By the banks of her own lagoon

               Dm       A                Dm
Didn't anybody tell her?  Didn't anybody see?
G7                       C     C/B
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
G7                        C   A
Tuesday's on the phone to me

A                              D  
  She said she'd always been a dancer
A                               D 
  She worked in fifteen clubs a day
A                                   D
  And though she thought I knew the answer
D                              A
  Well, I knew but I could not say

A                             D
 And so I quit the police department
A                         D    A
 And got myself a steady job
A                                 D
 And though she tried her best to help me
D                                  A
 She could steal but she could not rob
