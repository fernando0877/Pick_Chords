Strawberry Fields
Beatles

E  E7+  E7  F#m7  A7+  

A                                      Em
 Let me take you down, Cause I´m going to
                 F#7
Strawberry Fields, Nothing is real
    D              F#7
And Nothing to get hung about
 D         /C#        A
Strawberry Fields forever

E         E7+       E7
Living is easy with eyes closed
F#m        /E              D
  Misunderstanding all you see
D              E7           A
  It´s getting hard to be someone
       /G#       /F#   Em
But it all works out
D           E7          D     A
 It dosen't matter much to me 

E        E7+             E7
No one I think is in my tree
F#m        /E              D
 I mean it must be high or low
D            E7             A
 That is you can't you know,
       /G#       /F#   Em
Tune in, But it's aaaall right
D          E7             D       A
 That is I think it's not too bad 

E      E7+               E7
Always know, sometimes think it's me
F#m              F#m              D
  But you know I know when it's a dream
D          E7             A
 I think a 'No' I mean a 'Yes'
         C#m    F#m
But it's aaaall wrong
D           E7          D    A
  That is I think I disagree
