Beatles

    G
I think I'm gonna be sad   I think it's today, yeah
                                         Am D
The girl that's driving me mad is going away
 Em                      C   Em                      F
She's got a ticket to ride  she's got a ticket to ride
 Em                      D                  G
She's got a ticket to ride  but she don't care.

  G
She said that linving with me    was bringing her down, yeah !
                                            Am D
For she would never be free   when I was around
Em                      C    Em                      F
She's got a ticket to ride  she's got a ticket to ride
Em                       D                 G
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care

  C
I don't know why she's riding so high
                                                      D
She ought to think twice   she ought to do it right by me
 C
Before she gets to saying goodbye
                                                      D
She ought to think twice   she ought to do it right by me
