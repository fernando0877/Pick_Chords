Tomorrow Never Knows
Beatles

C
Turn off your mind relax and float downstream
          C11               C
It is not dying,  It is not dying
C
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
      C11             C
It is shining,  It is shining
C
That you may see the meaning of within
      C11           C
It is being,  It is being

     C
That love is all and love is everyone
      C11            C
It is knowing, It is knowing
     C
That ignorance and haste may mourn the dead
        C11              C
It is believing, It is believing
                  C
But listen to the colour of your dream
          C11                C
It is not living,  It is not living
   C
Or play the game of existence to the end
       C11               C
Of the beginning, Of the beginning,  Of the beginning
