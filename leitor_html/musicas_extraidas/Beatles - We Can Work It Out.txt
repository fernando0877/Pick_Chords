We Can Work It Out
Beatles

D                D4     
  Try to see it  my   way
D              D4               C                 D
  Do I have to keep, on talking till, I can't go on
D                    D4 
  While you see, it  your way
D                 D4                C                  D
  Run the risk of knowing, that our love, may soon be gone

G              D
We can work it out
G              A7
We can work it out

D                       D4    
  Think of what, you're say-ing
D                D4                   C                    D
  You can get it wrong, and still you think, that it's allright
D                       D4    
  Think of what, you're say-ing
D                 D4               C                   D
   We can work it out, and get it straight, or say goodnight

G              D
We can work it out
G              A7
We can work it out

Bm                      Bm/A      G     F#7(4)
Life is very short, and there's no tiiiiime
    F#           Bm           Bm/A        Bm/G       Bm/F#
For fussing, and fighting, my friend
Bm                             Bm/A   G     F#7(4)   
I, have, always, thought, that it's a criiiiiime
   F#       Bm       Bm/A  Bm/G    Bm/F#
So I, will, ask you, once, again

D                 D4     
  Try to see, it  my way
D                D4            C              D  
  Only time will tell, if I am right, or I am wrong
D                    D4   
  While you see, it  your way
D                        D4              C                D
  There's a chance, that we, might fall apart, before too long
