If I'd been out till, a quarter to three,

  would you lock the door?

  will you, still feed me?

  You'll be older too
Am            Dm
   And if you say the word,
F       G         C   G7
I could stay with you

C
I could be handy, mending a fuse
                      G7
when your lights have gone
You can, knit a, sweater, by the fire side,
G  Am  Bbm Bm
Sunday mornings, go for a ride

Doing the garden, digging the weeds,

  who could ask for more?

Every summer, we can rent, 
                          G
a cottage in, the Isle of Wight,
                Am
if it's not too dear

                    E7
We shall scrimp and save


Am                    Dm
     Grand, children, on your knee,
F     G          C     G7
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

C                                                    G7

G7
Indicate, precisely, what you mean, to say,
G     Am  Bbm Bm          C
yours sincerely, wasting away

C                                    C7             F
