While my guitar gently weeps
Beatles

 Am          Am/G*       Am/F#*              F
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
Am          G          D     E
While my guitar gently weeps
  Am          Am/G        Am/F#        F
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Am          G          C      E
Still my guitar gently weeps
 
A            C#m  F#m    C#m    
I don't know why, nobody told you,
Bm         /        E   E7sus
 how to unfold your love?
A            C#m  F#m        C#m
I don't know how, someone controlled you?
Bm              /     E  E7sus
They bought and sold you
  
  Am          Am/G        Am/F#       F
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
Am          G          D    E
While my guitar gently weeps
     Am       Am/G         Am/F#     F
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Am            G          C    E
  Still my guitar gently weeps
 
A            C#m  F#m        C#m
I don't know how, you were diverted,
Bm                 E  E7sus
You were perverted too?
A            C#m  F#m        C#m
I don't know how, you were inverted,
Bm             E  E7sus
No one alerted you?
 
  Am          Am/G        Am/F#             F
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
Am          G   D      E
While my guitar gently weeps
Am          Am/G   Am/F#  F
Look at you all...
Am          G          C      E
Still my guitar gently weeps
