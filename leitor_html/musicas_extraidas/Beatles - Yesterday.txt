Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away     
F          G7                        C       G/B   
   Now it looks as thought, they're here to stay     
           Am7   D       F      C     
       Oh! I believe in Yesterday     
      
C        Bm         E7            Am7         G  F      
Sunddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be     
F             G7             C     G/B   
    There's a shadow hanging over me     
        Am7     D        F   C     
    Oh! Yesterday, came suddenly  
      
    Bm   E7    Am    G    F            Dm6          
Oh! why  she   had   to   go, I don't  know   
     G7      C     
   She wouldn't say     
  Bm   E7      Am   G    F              Dm6                   
   I   said   something wrong, now I   long         
       G7      C     
  For yesterday    
      
 C        Bm       E7            Am7      G  F
Yesterday love was such an easy, game to play     
          G7            C     G/B  
  Now I need a place to hide away     
      Am7        D7         F   C     
  Oh!  I      believe, in Yesterday
   C      D   F    C     
  Hum hum hum hum hum hmm hmm
