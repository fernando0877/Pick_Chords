You Can't Do That
Beatles

      G7
I got something to say that might cause you pain,

If I catch you talking to that boy again
          C7                          G7
I'm gonna let you down, and leave you flat
          D7               C7              G7  D7
Because I told you before, oh you can't do that

              G7
Well it's the second time I caught you talking to him,

Do I have to tell you one more time it's a sin?
             C7                          G7
I think I'll let you down, and leave you flat
          D7               C7               G7
Because I told you before, oh, you can't do that

            B7    Em         Am              Bm        G7
Everybody's gree--en, 'cause I'm the one who won your love,
              B7    Em      Am                       Bm          D
But if they'd see---en, you talking that way, they'd laugh in my face

   G7
So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine,

I can t help my feelings I go outta my mind
          C7                          G7
I'm gonna let you down, and leave you flat
          D7               C7              G7   D7
Because I told you before, oh you canâ€™t do that 

            B7    Em         Am              Bm       G7
Everybody's gree--en, 'cause I'm the one who won your love,
              B7    Em      Am                       Bm          D
But if they'd see---en, you talking that way, they'd laugh in my face

   G7
So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine,

I can't help my feelings I go outta my mind
          C7                          G7
I'm gonna let you down, and leave you flat
          D7               C7              G7
Because I told you before, oh you can't do that
