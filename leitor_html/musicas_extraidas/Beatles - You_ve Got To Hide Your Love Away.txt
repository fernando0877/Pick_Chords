You've Got To Hide Your Love Away
Beatles

 G      D    F       G
Here I stand head in hand
 C                  F9   C
Turn my face to the wall
G         D      F       G
If she's gone I can't go on
 C               F   C   D
Feeling two foot sma-a-all

G     D    F       G
Everywhere people stare
C               F C
Each and every day
G     D        F        G
I can see them laugh at me
C                F  C  D D/C D/B D/A
And I, hear them sa-a-ay

 G                 C               D4    D D9    D
Hey! You've got to hide your, love away
 G                 C               D4    D D9    D
Hey! You've got to hide your, love away

 G      D  F    G
How can I, even try
C            F  C
I can, never win
G      D      F       G
Hearing them,  seeing them
 C               F  C  D
In the state I'm in-i-in

 G      D    F     G
How can she, say to me
C                F  C
Love will, find a way
G       D      F       G
Gather 'round, all you clowns
 C              F  C  D D/C D/B D/A
Let me hear you sa-a-ay
