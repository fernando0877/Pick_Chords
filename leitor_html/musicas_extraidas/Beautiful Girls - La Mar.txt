D                       Bm
  This day is getting older,
             F#m            G
in fading light, it's beautiful
D      /               Bm           
  This wind is blowing colder,
        F#m                  G
and too soon, I'll feel it's pull

      D
Still I, took all my chances,
       Bm
earned myself an even score
       F#m              G
Try to learn my lessons way yeah

    D
And I don't have the answers,
          Bm
for those questions anymore
     F#m                            G
Only love can beat both, heaven and hell

    D                            Bm
So sturdy up, sturdy up your heart,
        F#m           G
for the road is long ahead
     D                               Bm
I'll be with you, even though we're apart,
         F#m              G
but your road is yours to tread

       D               Bm
And so it goes, and so it goes,
       F#m                 G
and so it goes, slows your mind, mind, mind
   D               Bm   
so it goes, and so it goes,
       F#m                 G                       D
and so it goes, slows your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind

D  Bm D/F# G
