  When I wake into the morning sun,
Em                     D
  Well, I feel another day has just begun

Em                             D
  I see those clouds up in the skyyyy
Em                                D
  And I don't care, everything is gonna be alright

Em                      G
 And I want you to know, some feelings come and go
A                              Em
  But for you mine, will never change
Em                         G
  It's harder than it seems, to know what to believe,
A                             Em
  Here in my mind, I hold you close

Em                 G
  I got to keep on walking
                  A               Em
With my head held high, because I see,
Em                 G
  The sky on a day like
           A               Em
This and I know, I will be free, Oh I will be, Free
