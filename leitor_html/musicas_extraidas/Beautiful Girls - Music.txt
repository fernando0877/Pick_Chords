  Hey girl I love you,
F                                        Bb
Dancing around like that, will drive me, cra-zy on
F                  Bb
  But why, would I want you,
          F                          Bb
When it's plain, you're not ever, wanting me?

     F                             Bb
Well my, whole life all I, had was this guitar
               F                           Bb
Never gonna be lonely, when all I have, is music in my heart.
      F                        Bb
Never gonna wanna be something not not

Hey my friend's like that,
He drives all those little girls crazy on
Say did you see us,
In the background of the crowd on the TV?

On a summer's day we go and catch some morning waves.
Hanging out with my friends and the vibe can only be ok.
Just like I don't remember rainy days when I was small,
You know I won't remember hatred or nothing at all.

No tempremental alibis,
And I'm not wasting, all my time.
And I'm looking for, the truth in this.
And I don't know ,just what I'll get, just what I'll get.

'Cause I got this in music
