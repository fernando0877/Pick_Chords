Beautiful Girls

       Dm                                          G7
Well I woke up, last night, could, I tell if I was dreaming
  Dm
I thought I saw the face, of an angel
      G7
and'I heard her spea,king to me

Dm
She said my boy, don't fill up your head,
     G7
with trivial things
      Dm
cause life's too beautiful,
           G7
for you to leave

F                        C
 Just like periscopes up in the sky,
       G7                                   Bb                 C
Well I ha'never seen a girl as beautiful as you, in my whole liiif

F                                C
f'And things don't always go the way you plan them,
            G7                                             Bb
But if your rolling with the flow, well then it makes it easier
          C         Dm   G7   (Dm   G7)
Makes it easier to bare       

              Dm                                      G7
I'll give you kisses, on your neck, just like I always promised
    Dm                                 G7
You float into my mind, like pictures, of an earthly godess
    Dm                                         G7
She said my boy don't fill up your heart, with nothing but love
     Dm                                G7
That truth, is truth to you, is truth enough
