Devil's Haircut
Beck

 D       /   G      C        /       /   / 
 Something's wrong 'cause my mind is fading
 And everywhere I look, there's a dead end waiting
 Temperature's dropping at, the rotten oasis
 Stealing kisses, from the leperous faces

 Heads are hanging from, the garbage man trees
 Mouthwash jukebox gas-oline
 Pistols are pointing, at a poor man's pockets
 Smiling eyes, ripping out of his sockets

       D       G       C   /     /    /
 Got a devil's haircut in my mind (4x)

 Love machines on the sympathy crutches
 Discount orgies on the dropout buses
 Hitching a ride, with the bleeding noses
 Coming to town, with the brief case blues
