Jack-ass
Beck

A                            D
I been drifting along in the same stale shoes
A                                D
Loose ends, tying a noose in the back of my mind
       A
If you thought that you were making your way
             D
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
              A                          D
I'll put it together: It's a strange invitation

       A                                D
When I wake up someone will sweep up my lazy bones
   A                            D
we will rise in the cool of the evening
    A
I remember the way that you smiled
         D
When the gravity shackles were wild
                 A     
And something is vacant
                         D
 when I think it's all beginning
