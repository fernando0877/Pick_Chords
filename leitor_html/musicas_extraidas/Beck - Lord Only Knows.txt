Lord Only Knows
Beck

 B                G#                     E              B
You only got one finger left and it's pointing at the door
 B                     G#                E                  B
And you're taking for granted what the Lord's made on the floor
 B                     G#         E                   B
So I'm picking up the pieces and putting them up for sale
 B                              G#              E            B
Throw your meal ticket out the window put your skeletons in jail

F#                                 B
Cuz' Lord only knows it's getting late
F#                                   B
Your senses are gone so don't you hesitate
   E               G#             B              G#
To give yourself a call let your bottom dollars fall
G                     F#              B
Throwing your two bit cares down the drain

 B                G#         E                 B
Invite me to the seven seas, like some seasick man
 B          G#                 E                  B
you do whatever you please and I'll do whatever I can
 B        G#                 E                B
Titanic, fare thee well, my eyes are turning pink
 B                      G#           E             B
Don't call us when the new age gets old enough to drink

B       A       F#     E      B      A
Odelay odelay odelay odelay odelay odelay
      F#             E    B       A      F#    E
Just passing through,    odelay odelay odelay odelay
