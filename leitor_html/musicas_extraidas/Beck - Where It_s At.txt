Where It's At
Beck

There's a destination a little up the road
From the habitations and the towns we know
A place we saw the lights turn low
Jig-saw jazz and the get-fresh flow
Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts
Two turntables and a microphone
Bottles and cans Just clap your hands 
and just clap your hands

Where it's at
I got two turn tables and a microphone (4x)

Pick yourself up off the side of the road
With your elevator bones and your whip-flash tones
Members only, Hyponotizers
Move through the room like ambulance drivers
Shine your shoes with your microphone blues
Hirsuits with your parachute flutes
Passing the dutchee from coast to coast
Let the man Gary Wilson
rock the most
