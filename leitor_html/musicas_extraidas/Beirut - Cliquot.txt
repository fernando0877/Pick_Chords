Bm
A plague in the workhouse,
a plague on the poor
         Em
Now I'll beat on my drum 'til I'm dead
Bm
Yesterday, a fever, tomorrow, St. Peter
     Em
I'll beat on my drum until then

         Bm                              Em
what melody will lead, my lover from his bed?
         Bm                           Em
What melody will see him in, my arms again?

Set fire to foundation 
and burn out the station
You'll never get nothing of mine

The pane of my window 
will flicker and glimmer
I won't leave a stitching behind (Refr√£o /Solo Voz)

D    A            Em           Em
I'll siing of the walls, of the well,
                                  D
and the house, at the top, of the hill
D     A           Em         Em
 I'll sing of the bottles of wine
                               D
that we left, on our old windowsill
D      A           Em    Em
  I'll sing of the usual spin
                             D
getting sadder and older, Oh love
        A                  Em
and the cold, the oncoming cold
