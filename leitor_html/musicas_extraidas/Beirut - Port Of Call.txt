Port Of Call
Beirut
Time: 6/8

Em       C6                        D
I    I called through the air that night
  G                      D
A calm sea voiced with a lie
        Am
I could only smile
                    D
I've been alone sometime
Am                        D
And all in all, It's been fun

Em   C6                  D
you, you had hope for me now
   G                       D
I danced all around it somehow
   Am
Be fair to me
               D
I may drift a while
        Am
Were it up to me
           D
You'd know why
Em       C                          D
I,  I called through the air that night
              G          D
The fault was warming inside
    Am                           D
Was it infantile that which we desire?
        Am                      D
Were it up to me, all from your eyes

( Em      A )  (4x)

And I, I called through the air that night
My thoughts were still blurry in time
We were closer then
I'd been alone some time
Filled your glass with gin
Filled your heart with pride

You, you had hope for me now
I danced all around it somehow
Be fair to me
I may drift awhile
If there's a plan for me
Would it make you smile?

Am                     D
No, I don't want to be there for no one
         Am
I'd stay here
                       D
No, I don't want to be there for no one
                Am
That's over the sea (2x)

                 D
I don't want to follow your light
       Am
On the sea
                       D
No, I don't want to be there for no one
That I can't see
