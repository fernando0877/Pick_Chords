tom orig F, violao capo 5, 
     F                          A
The times we haad, Oh, when the wind, 

would blow, with rain, and snow
     F
Were not all bad
            A
We put our feet, just where, they had
         F            A
Hauad to go, Never to go

    F                           A 
The shattered soul, Following close 
but neearly, twice, as slow
     F                            A
Were my good tiimes, There were always 
golden, rocks, to throw
         F                 A
At those who, Those who admiiit, defeeat, too late
               F                       A
Those were our tiiimes, Those were our tiiimes

And I will love, to see that day

    Bb                 F
And plaaaying songs in May

And III would love to see that daaay
