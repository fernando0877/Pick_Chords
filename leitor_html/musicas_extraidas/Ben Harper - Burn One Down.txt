Burn One Down
Ben Harper

G
 Let us burn one From end to end
Em                     C
  And pass it over, To me my friend
G
  Burn it long, we'll burn it slow
Em              C
  To light me up before I go

        G
If you don't like my fire
     Em
Then don't come around
      Em        D        C    G
Cause I'm gonna burn one down
    Em        D        C   
Yes I'm gonna burn one down

   G
My choice is what I, choose to do
           Em
And if I'm causing no harm
             C
It shouldn't bother you

     G                  G
Your choice is who, you choose to be
    Em              Em                     C
And if your causin' no harm, Then you're alright with me

        G
If you don't like my fire
     Em
Then don't come around
      Em        D        C    G
Cause I'm gonna burn one down
    Em        D        C   
Yes I'm gonna burn one down

    G                        
Herb the gift, from the earth,
           Em                              C
And what's from the earth, Is of the greatest worth
    G
So before you knock it try it first
        Em                           C
You'll see it's a blessing, And not a curse
