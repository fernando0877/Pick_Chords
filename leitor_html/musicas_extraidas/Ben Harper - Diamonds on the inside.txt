Diamonds on the inside
Ben Harper
Capo: 1

G              Am
 I knew a girl, Her name was truth
Bm         Am       G
 She was a horrible liar
She couldnt spend one day alone
But she couldnt be satisfied

When you have everything,
You have everything to lose
She made herself
A bed of nails
And shes plannin on puttin it to use

              F        C      G
Cause she had diamonds on the inside
She had diamonds on the inside
She had diamonds on the inside
Diamonds

G, Am, Bm, Am, G
A candle throws its light into the darkness
In a nasty world,
so shines the good deed
Make sure the fortune, that you seek
Is the fortune you need

So tell me why, the first to ask, 
is the last to give, every time
What you say and do not mean
Follow too close behind

F, C , G
Cause she had diamonds on the inside
She had diamonds on the inside
She wore diamonds on the inside
Diamonds

D, C, Em (<< Solo) D, C, Em.. C, C, D,D
   
G, Am, Bm, Am, G
Like a soldier standing long under fire
Any change comes as a relief
Let the givers name remain unspoken
For she is just a generous thief

F, C , G
But she had diamonds on the inside
Cause she had diamonds on the inside
She wore diamonds on the inside
She wore diamonds
Oh diamonds
She had diamonds
She wore diamonds
Diamonds
