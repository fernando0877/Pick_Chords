She's Only Happy In The Sun

capo 2, tom D

D                           Em
 I know you may not want to see me
        G       A         D
On your way down from the clouds
D                       Em
 Would you hear me if I told you
         G      A         D   D7
That my heart is with you now

G           A            Bm   A
 She's only happy in the sun
G           A            C9    G
 She's only happy in the sun

D                           Em
 Did you find what you were after?
                  G      A                   D
The pain and the laughter brought you to your knees
D                        Em             G
 But if the sun sets you free, sets you free
A                 D       D7
 You'll be free indeed, Indeed

G           A            Bm   A
 She's only happy in the sun
G           A            C9    G
 She's only happy in the sun

D                       Em                   G
 Every time I hear you laughing, I hear you laughing
A            D
 It makes me cry
D                  Em            G
 Like the story of life, of your life
A             D   D7
 Is hello, goodbye

G           A            Bm   A
 She's only happy in the sun
G           A            C9    G
 She's only happy in the sun
