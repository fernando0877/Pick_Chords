Steal my kisses
Ben Harper

G                           C
I put into Nashville, Tennessee
    D                                    G
but you wouldn't even come around to see me
And SInce your headin up to CaroLIna,    
You know I gonna be right there beHInd you

'Cause I always have to steal my kisses from YOU
Always have to steal my kisses from you

Now I love to feel that warm southern rain, 
just to hear it fall is the sweetest sounding things
And to see it fall on your simple country dress 
it's like heaven to me I must confess

Now I've been hangin around you for days,
when I'm leanin you just turn your head away
Uuuuooooh I know you didn't mean that
She said I LOve the way you think, but I hate the way you act
