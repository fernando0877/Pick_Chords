G               Bm             Em
Shadows grow so long before my eyes
            C                  F7
And they're moving, across the page
G            Bm             Em
Suddenly the day turns into night 
     C            F7
far away from the city
    Bm        E7               Am          D7
But don't hesitate, Cause your love, won't wait

G      D                 Am          Am
  Ooh, baby, I love your way. Wanna tell you, I love your way
G       D                 Am          Am
  Wanna be with you night and day

G               Bm                  Em
Moon appears to shine and light the sky
         C               F7
With the help, from some fire-fly
G               Bm                Em
Wonder how they have the power to shine
         C                   F7
Like can see them, under the pine.
    Bm        E7               Am          D7
But don't hesitate, Cause your love, won't wait

G             Bm             Em
I can see the sunset in your eyes
          C               F7
Brown and grey and blue besides
G                   Bm             Em
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
         C                     F7
I wish I could buy one, out of season
    Bm        E7               Am          D7
But don't hesitate, Cause your love, won't wait
