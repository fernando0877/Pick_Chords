Ain't no sunshine
Bill Withers

Am                            Am     Em G Am
Ain't no sunshine, when she's gone.
Am                         Am        Em G Am
It's not warm, when she's away

                              Em 
Ain't no sunshine, when she's gone, 
                            Dm
and she's always, gone too long,
                   Am      Em G Am
Anytime, she goes away

Am                            Am     Em G Am
Wonder this time, where she's gone,
Am                      Am       Em G Am
Wonder if, she's gone to stay

                              Em 
Ain't no sunshine, when she's gone, 
                            Dm
and she's always, gone too long,
                   Am      Em G Am
Anytime, she goes away

Am
I know, I know, I know, I know, 
I know, I know, I know, I know

Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone


                                  Am      Em G Am
But ain't no sunshine, when she's gone
                                  Am      Em G Am
But ain't no sunshine, when she's gone
Am                  Am      Em G Am
only darkness, everyday

                              Em
Ain't no sunshine, when she's gone, 
                              Dm
and this house, just ain't no home
                   Am      Em G Am
Anytime, she goes away
