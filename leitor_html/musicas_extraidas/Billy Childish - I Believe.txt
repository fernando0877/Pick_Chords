Em
Throw your arms about me, 
like a net cast to the sea
tell me your thoughts about me, 
and tell me you'll never leave, 
you'll never leave, you'll never leave

Place your lips to mine 
like the flower loves the bee
Tell me your dreams about me
and make sure that I believe, 
I believe, I believe

Raise your legs and squeeze 
like the spider eats the fly
Tell your desires of me 
and tell me the reason why, 
the reason why, the reason why

hold your love to me 
like the sun pinned to the sky
show me your feelings for me
and swear that you'll always be mine, 
always be mine, always be mine

give me your heart only 
like blood cupped in your hands
tell me the days you'll love me
and make sure that I understand 
I understand, I understand

Speak these words to me 
like the gospel spoke unto you, 
and I'll believe your story 
and know that you'll be true, 
you'll be true, you'll be true
