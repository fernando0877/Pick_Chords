Dancing With Myself
Billy Idol

       E
On the floor of Tokyo, 
           F#m
Or down in London town to go-o
         B7                          /
With the record selection, With the mirror reflection
    A              B7
I'm dancing with myself

             E
When there's no, one else in sight
          F#m
Or in the crowded lonely night
       B7                    /
Well I wait so long, For my love vibration
        A              B7
And I'm dancing with myself

          E
Oh,oh I'm dancing with myself,
          F#m
O, oh Iâ€™m dancing with myself
             B7
Well there's nothing to lose,
        A
there's nothing to prove
        F#m            B7
I'll be dancing with myself,
         E           F#m
oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, 
         E            B7
oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, If I

E                      /
Looked all over the wo-orld
            F#m
And there's every type of girl
        B7                /     
But your'empty eyes, Seem to pass me by
         A              B7
Leave me dancing with myself

         E            /
So let's sink another drink
            F#m
Cause it'll give me time to think
     B7                           /
If I had the chance, I'd ask the world to dance
            A              B7
And I'll be dancing with myself
