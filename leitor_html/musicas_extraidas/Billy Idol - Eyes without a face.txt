Eyes without a face
Billy Idol

E            C#m
I'm all out of hope
                G#m               B
One more bad dream could bring a fall

E               C#m
When I'm far from home
                       G#m
Don't call me on the phone
                     B
To tell me you're alone

E              C#m
It's easy to deceive
               G#m
It's easy to tease
                   B
But hard to get release

A                B                  A
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
A                B
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
A                B                    F#m
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
               G#m7                    E
Got no human grace your eyes without a face.
E  C#m  G#m  B 

E                C#m
I spend so much time
                    G#m
Believing all the lies
                   B
To keep the dream alive

E              C#m
Now it makes me sad
                    G#m
It makes me mad at truth
                     B
For loving what was you

:refrão

(E - D) rep...
When you hear the music you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas oh, the 
gigolo pool

Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinkin' it down, oh
I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books tryin' to stay hip
I'm thinkin' of you you're out there so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers

E             C#m
Now I close my eyes
             G#m
And I wonder why
            B
I don't despise

E            C#m
Now all I can do
                 G#m
Is love what was once
              B
So alive and new

                         F#m
But it's gone from your eyes
                B
I'd better realise

Refrão:

               G#m7                      E
Such a human waste your eyes without a face

And now it's getting worse.
