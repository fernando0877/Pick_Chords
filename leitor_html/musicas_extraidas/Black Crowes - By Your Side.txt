By Your Side
Black Crowes

          D
When your lost, there I am found
When you slip, I hooold my ground
When I fall, Please take a bow
when you're up, Just remember I am down

People looking, for Fortune and fame
They don't know, That it's all the same
It's like any, other game
You know there's a loser But it's alright

         C          G              D 
When you feel, your heart, is breaking
     C         G                D 
When all, your friends, are faking
         C       G          D 
When its giving, and, no taking
       C   G          D 
I will be, by your side


I've been over the hill and back
Survived every kind of attack
It's been a few years at that
As a matter of fact

Good luck is just good luck
You don't go hungry if you got pot luck
I've been down
But never on my knees
I see the forest for the trees
