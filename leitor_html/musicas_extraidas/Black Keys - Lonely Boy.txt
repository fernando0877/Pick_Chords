Lonely Boy
Black Keys

E
Well I'm so above you
         G       A
And it's fine to see
      E                   G    A
But I came to love you anywaaaay
       E
So you tore my heart out
      G          A
And I don't mind bleeding
E
Any old time to keep me waiting
G        A
Waiting, waiting

E         G                 A
Oh, oh oh I got a love that keeps me waiting
E         G                 A
Oh, oh oh I got a love that keeps me waiting
E
I'm a lonely boy
G            A
I'm a lonely boy
E         G                 A
Oh, oh oh I got a love that keeps me waiting

E                                G     A
Well your mama kept you but your daddy left you
      E                           G    A
And I should've done you just the saaaame
      E                      G       A
But I came to love you, am I born to bleed?
E
Any old time you keep me waiting
G        A
Waiting, waiting
