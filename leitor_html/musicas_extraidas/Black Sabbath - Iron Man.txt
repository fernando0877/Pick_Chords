Has he lost his mind? Can hee seeee, or is, he blind?
Bm  D  /    E   /   G                D  /    E  /
Can he walk at all? Or if he mooves, wi-ill, he fall?


Bm  D  /    E    /   G                D  /    E   /
Is he 'live or dead? Has he thoughts, within, his head?
Bm    D    /    E    /     G                 D    E  
We'll just pass him there. Why-yy-yy should, we e-ven, care?

He was turned to steel, in a great magnetic field
Where he traveled time, for the future of mankind
E                 D
Nobody wants him, He just stares, a-at the world
Planning his vengeance, that he will soon unfurl


Riff1
Now the time is here, for Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave, kills the people he once 


E                 D
Nobody wants him, They just turn their head
E                 D
Nobody helps him. Now he has his revenge

Riff1
Heavy bolts of lead, fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can, Iron Man on lives again
