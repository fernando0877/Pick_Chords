Some people say, my love, Cannot be true
Please believe me, my  love, And I'll show you
I will give you, those things, You thought unreal
The sun the  moon, the stars, All bear my  seal

Follow me now, and you, Will not regret
Leaving the life, you led, Before we met
You are the  first to  have, This love of mine
Forever with me  till, The end of time

E               D           C         B7 
  Your love for me has just got to be real
E            D                C        B7 
  Before you know the way I'm going to feel
C              B7   C             B7
  I'm going to feel, I'm going to feel,

Now I have you with me, Under my  power
Our love grows stronger now, With every  hour
Look into  my   eyes, you'll, See who I   am
My name is Lu,cifer, Please take my  hand

Follow me  now  and you, Will not re_gret
Leaving the  life you led,Before we  met
You are the  first to  have,This love of mine
Forever with me  till, The end of time
