    C#7                         /               
The light in the window, is a crack in the sky
   C#7                         /                Em
A stairway to darkness, in the blink of an eye  
  C#7                                                  G#
A levee of tears, to learn, she'll never, be coming back
    C#7                                          G#
The man in the dark, will bring another attack   

C#7         Ebm               E  
  Your mama told you, that you're not,
             A
supposed, to talk to strangers
C#7           Ebm         E            
  Look in the mirror, tell me do, you think, 
     A                    Eb    E
your life's, in danger? Yea-ah

Another day passes, as the night closes in  
    C#7                                             G#
The red light goes on, to say it's time to begin ,  

C#7          Ebm         E    
   I see the man, around the corner, 
        A
waiting can, he see me?
C#7           Ebm           E   
   I close my eyes, and wait to hear,
               A                 Eb  E
the sound, of someone screaming here

        C#7 B  Bb A  /
No more tears (4x)

   C#7                          /                   G#
So now that it's over, can't we just say goodbye?   
    C#7                           /                     G#
I'd like to move on, and make the most of the night     
C#7                    /                  G#
Maybe a kiss, before I leave you this way 
     C#7                       /                           G#
Your lips are so cold, I don't know what else to say       

C#7     Ebm      E             A
I never wanted it to end this way, my love, my darling
C#7        Ebm       E             A                Eb  E
Believe me when I say to you in love I think I'm falling here,
