No Rain
Blind Melon

E                         D
All I can say, is that my Life is pretty plain
  A                          G     E
I like watching the puddles, gather rain
    E                      D
And all I can do,  is just Pour some tea for two
    A                           G        E
And speak my point of view But (it's not sane)
         E
itâ€™s not sane 2x

E         D               E          D
  I just, want someone to say to me, No oh oh oh
E             D                  E     D
  I'll always be, there when you wake
E                    D               E         D
You know I'd like to Keep, my cheeks dry today
E              D                    E    D
  So stay with me, and I'll have it made

  E                        D
I don't understand, why I sleep all day
       A                          G          E     
and I staaart, to complain , that there's no rain
    E                       D
and all I can do, is read a book to stay awake
   A                     G      E
It rips my life away but it's a great
