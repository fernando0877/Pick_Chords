Once I had a love and it was a gas;
C#m                               E
soon turned out, I had a heart of glass
                                   C#
Seemed like the real thing only to find;
C#m                          E
much mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine;
C#m                            E
soon found out I was losing my mind
                                           C#
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind;
C#m                          E
much mistrust, love's gone behind

A                                           E
In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
                                A
Love is so confusing there's no peace of mind,
