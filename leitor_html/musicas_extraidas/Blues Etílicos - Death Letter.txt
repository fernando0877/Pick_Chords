Poor n' guy, got to lay there till... Judgement day

Poor n' guy, got to lay, there till Judgement day
(solo)


Well I, fold my arm.. and I slowly walked away
That's alright people.. Your trouble, gonna come someday
fold my arm.. and I slowly walked away
That's alright people.. Your trouble, gonna come someday

Now you know some people tell me, that, blues ain't bad
Well that's the worst, feelin I think I,  have ever had

Some people got the nerve to tell me, blues ain't bad
they must not've had Same old blues I had
