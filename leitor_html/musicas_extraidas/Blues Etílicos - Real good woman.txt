Real good woman
Blues Et√≠licos

           E7
I've got a real good woman, She's so nice and kind
           A7                                 E7
I've got a real good woman, She's so nice and kind
B7                        A7                              E7
When she starts to love me, She seems to ease, my worried mind

    E7 
She leaves out, in the evening, and don't commom, til breack of dawn
    A7                                                          E7
She leaves out, in the evening, and don't commom, til breack of dawn
        B7                    
I don't know, where she gets this money
A7                          E7
   But I know, she wouldn't do me wrong


    E7
She works hard every night, She know how to do it right
    A7
She works hard every night, She know, how to do it right
B7                       A7                           E7
When she comes back home, She really ease, my worried mind
