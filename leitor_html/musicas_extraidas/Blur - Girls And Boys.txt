Girls And Boys

Gm C F Eb F#/F (batida bem dividida)
Gm                        C
Streets like a jungle, So call the police
F                           Eb
Following the herd, Down to Greece
On holiday

Gm                C
Love in the '90s, Is paranoid
F                            Eb
On sunny beaches, Take your chances
Looking for


Gm                               
Girls who are boys, 
Who like boys, 
to be girls
       C  
Who do boys, 
like they're girls, 
Who do girls, 
like they're boys
F                                    Eb
Always should be, someone you really love


 Gm                       C
Avoiding all work, 'Cause there's none available
     F                            Eb
Like battery thinkers, Count your thoughts
On 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 fingers

Gm                 C
Nothing is wasted, Only reproduced
    F                         Eb
You get nasty blisters, to be section
But we haven't been introduced

oooh oh oh oh oh oh
