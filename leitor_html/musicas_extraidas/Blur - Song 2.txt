Song 2
Blur

capo 1, tom orig F

         F            Eb    G#   Bb   C7
I got my head checked
        F        Eb   C7
By a jumbo jet
          F     Eb    C7
It wasn't easy
            F     Eb    C7
But nothing i-iis,     (no... uhhuuuuu)

F     Eb         G#            C7
          When I feel, heavy metal... uhhhh
F     Eb         G#            C7
         And I'm pins, and I'm needles
F     Eb         G#         C 
         Well I lie and I'm easy
F                        G#
All of the time, and I'm never show
       C#                              (riff)
 why I need you, ...Pleased to meet ya 

         F            Eb    C 
I got my head done
         F            Eb    C 
When I was young
         F            Eb    C 
It's not my problem
         F            Eb    C 
It's not my problem

Em      D          G
Yeah, yeah (4x)
