Tender is the touch of someone that you love too much
A                     G          A
Tender is the day the demons go away
A                   G                    A
Lord I need to find someone who can, can heal my mind

Tender is the ghost, the ghost I love the most
A                    G               A
Hiding from the sun, waiting for the night to come
A                      G              A
Tender is my heart for screwing up my life
A                   G                    A
Lord I need to find someone who can, can heal my mind
