Blowin in The Wind
Bob Dylan
Key: C

(capo 2, tom D, gaita D)
C        F            C
How many roads Must a man walk down
C          F          G
Before you call him a man
        C        F           G          C
Yes and how many seas Must a white dove sail
            F            G
Before she sleeps in the sand

        C        F         G
Yes and how many times Must cannonballs fly
                F       G
Before they're forever banned

    F           G         C              Am
The answer, my friend, Is blowin' in the wind
    F         G              C
The answer is blowin' in the wind

      C        F           G
Yes, how many years Must a mountain exist
              F             C
Before it is washed to the sea
                  F             G
Yes and how many years Can some people exist
                  F            G
Before they're allowed to be free

         C        F
Yes and how many times Must a man turn his head
                     F            C
And pretend that he just doesn't see
      C        F           G
Yes, how many times,Must a man look up
               F               C
Before he can really see the sky

                 F         G
Yes and how many ears,Must one man have
               F            G
Before he can hear people cry
         C        F             G
Yes and how many deaths,Will it take till he knows
               F           C
That too many people have died
