It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 
F                      C   G 
  If you don't know by now 
       C               G              Am        Am/G 
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 
D7/F#               G   G7
  I'll never do somehow 
          C                    C7
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn 
F                         D7/F#
 Look out your window and I'll be gone 
C          G          Am   Am/G F
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on 
C/G         G               C
Don't think twice, it's all right

F                    C       G 
  That light I never knowed
       C               G               Am          Am/G 
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
D7/F#                         G    G7
  I'm on the dark side of the road
        C                                 C7
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
   F                         D7/F#
To try and make me change my mind and stay
C         G            Am      Am/G F
 We never did too much talkin' any -way
C/G         G               C

So, it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
F                       C       G 
  Like you never done before
       C               G              Am          Am/G 
And It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal

  I can't hear you anymore
      C                        C7
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin' down the road
  F                      D7/F#
I once loved aw woman, a child I'm told
  C           G             Am     Am/G F
I gave her my heart but she wanted my   soul
C/G         G               C

Where I'm bound, I can't tell
    C         G          Am          Am/G
But goodbye's too good a word, babe
D7/F#                        G     G7
  So I'll just say fare thee well
C                          C7
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
    F                         D7/F#
You could have done better but I don't mind
C              G        Am  Am/G     F
You just kinda wasted my    precious time
C/G         G               C
