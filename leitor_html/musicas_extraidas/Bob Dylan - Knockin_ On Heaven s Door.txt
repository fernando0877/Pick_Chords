G                 D            Am
  Mama take, this badge off of me
G                D          C
  Cause, I can't use it, anymore


G                    D             Am
  It's getting dark, too dark to see 
G                  D                     C
  I feel like, I'm knocking, on heaven's door



G                 D                   Am
  Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
G                 D                   C
  Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door (2x)



G             D               Am
  Mama, put that gun to the ground
G           D            C
  I can't shoot them anymore

G                        D              Am
  There's a long black cloud coming on down
G                   D                   C
  I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door
