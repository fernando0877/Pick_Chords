Rainy Day Women
Bob Dylan

E7
They'll stone you when you're trying, to be so good

They'll stone you just like they said they would
A7
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home
    E7
And they'll stone you when you're there all alone
      B7                           E7
But I would not feel so all alone, Everybody must get stoned


They'll stone you when you're... walking on the street
They'll stone you when you're... tryin' to keep your seat
They'll stone you when you're... walkin' on the floor
They'll stone you when you're... walkin' to the door
But I would not feel so all alone... Everybody must get stoned


They'll stone you when you're... at the breakfast table
They'll stone you when youâ€™re... young and able
They'll stone you when you're... tryin' to make a buck
They'll stone you and then... they'll say good luck
But I would not feel so all alone... Everybody must get stoned


Well, theyll stone you and say that its the end
Then theyll stone you and then theyll come back again
Theyll stone you when youre riding in your car
Theyll stone you when youre playing your guitar
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,Everybody must get stoned


Theyll stone you when you walk all alone
Theyll stone you when you are walking home
Theyll stone you and then say you are brave
Theyll stone you when you are set down in your grave
But I would not feel so all alone,Everybody must get stoned
