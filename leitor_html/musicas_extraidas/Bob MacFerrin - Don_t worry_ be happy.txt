Don't worry, be happy
Bob MacFerrin

 Here's a little song I wrote
    Dm               
You might want to sing it note for note
      F         C
Don't worry, be happy

In every life, we have some trouble, 
But when you worry, you make it double,
Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, be happy, uhhh

Ain't got no place , to lay your head
Somebody came, and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy

The landlord say,your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, be happy
-------
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal, to make you smile
Don't worry, be happy

'Cause when you worry, your face will frown
And that will brin, everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
