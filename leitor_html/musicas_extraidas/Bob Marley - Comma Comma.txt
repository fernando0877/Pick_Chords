G               C
Comma, comma, come back here,
G              C
My-y young lady;
G               C
Comma, comma, come back here to me,
G              C
My-y young lady, yeah!
G              C
Jus' while I thought
G               C               G
Everything was running smooth,

C
She left me
G          C
While I was in the mood.
G         C
Now I'm callin' to you,
G       C
But my world is relying for you to:

G               C
Comma, comma, come back here,
G             C
My-y young lady, yeah!
G               C
Comma, comma, come back here to me,
G             C
My-y young lady!
G               C
Jus' while I thought
G               C
Everything was running smooth
G               C
You know I love you; Oh now I love you.
