Don't let them fool you

Oh, no
       Bm
We've got a mind of our own

  Bm  (Riff 1)
The road of life is rocky

And you may stumble too

So while you point your fingers

Someone else is judging you

 Bm  (Riff 1)
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
 Bm  (Riff 1)
Could you be, could you be loved?
 Bm  (Riff 1)
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?

Could you be, could you be loved?

Bm                       Em
  Don't let them change you
Bm                   Em
  Or even rearrange you
     Bm
Oh, no
                         G  F#m
We've got a life to live
Em        Bm
 They say only, only
          G              F#m             A
Only the fittest of the fittest shal survive

Stay alive

  You ain't gonna miss your water
Bm  (Riff 1)
  Until you well runs dry
Bm  (Riff 1)
  No matter how you treat him
Bm  (Riff 1)
  The man will never be satisfied

Bm  (Riff 1)
  Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Bm  (Riff 1)
  Could you be, could you be loved?

 Bm  (Riff 1)
Say something
