Easy Skanking
Bob Marley




  Bb
Easy skanking, (skanking it easy)
  Gm
Easy skanking, (skanking it slow)
  Bb
Easy skanking, (skanking it easy)

Easy skanking, (skanking it slow)

           Bb
Excuse me while I light my spliff
         Eb
Oh God I got to take a lift
          Bb
From reality I just can't drift
         Eb
That's why I am staying with this riff
