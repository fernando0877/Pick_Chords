When ya see Jah light
Let me tell you if you're not wrong 

Everything is all right
So we gonna walk, all right! 

Through the roads of creation
We the generation
Trod through great tribulation

Exodus, aMovement of Jah people!
Exodus: Movement of Jah people! Oh, yeah!


Open your eyes (and look within)
Are you satisfied (with the life you're living)?
We know where we're going,
We know where we're from
We're leaving Babylon
We're going to our Father land

Exodus: Movement of Jah people

(Movement of Jah people!) Send us another brother Moses
(Movement of Jah people!) From across the Red Sea (2x)

Movement of Jah people!

Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

Open your eyes (and look within)
Are you satisfied 
with the life you're living?
We know where we're going
(We know where we're from)
(We're leaving Babylon, y'all!)
(We're going to our Father's land)

Exodus, all right! Movement of Jah people!

Wipe away transgression
