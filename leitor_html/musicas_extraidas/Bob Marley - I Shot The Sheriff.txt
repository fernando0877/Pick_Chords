I Shot The Sheriff

Gm                   Cm                      Gm
  I shot the sheriff, But I did not shoot the deputy (2x)

Eb7+   Dm7         Gm
  All around in my old town
          Eb7+     Dm7        Gm
  They're trying to track me down
      Eb7+              Dm7         Gm
 They say they want to bring me in guilty
         Eb7+      Dm7  Gm
 For the killing of a   deputy
         Eb7+      Dm7 Gm
For the life of a deputy, But I say
Gm                  Cm                    Gm
I shot the sheriff, But I swear it was in self defence
Gm                 Cm                    Cm
I shot the sheriff, And they say it is a capital offence

Eb7+      Dm7       Gm
 Sheriff John Brown always hated me
      Eb7+  Dm7       Gm
For what    I don't know
       Eb7+    Dm7    Gm
Every time I plant a seed
        Eb7+      Dm7      Gm
He said "Kill them before it grow (2x)
Gm                  Cm                    Gm
I shot the sheriff, But I swear it was in self defence
Gm                 Gm                  Cm
I shot the sheriff, And they say it is a capital offence

  Eb7+        Dm7   Gm
Freedom came my way one day
       Eb7+  Dm7     Gm
And I started out of town
Eb7+        Dm7      Gm
   All of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown
Eb7+          Dm7      Gm
    Aiming to shoot me down
     Eb7+    Dm7                Gm
So I shot, I shot , I shot  him down,
Gm                Cm                        Gm
I shot the sheriff, But I did not shoot the deputy (2x)

  Eb7+           Dm7       Gm
Reflexes got the better of me
      Eb7+      Dm7     Gm
And what is to be must be
       Eb7+    Dm7     Gm
Every day the bucket I go I well
Eb7+        Dm7         Gm
One day the bottom will drop out (2x)
