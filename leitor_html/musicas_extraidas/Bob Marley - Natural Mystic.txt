Natural Mystic
Bob Marley

          Dm             G                  Am
There's a natural mystic blowing thru' the air,
       Dm             G               Am
if you listen carefully now, you will hear


           Dm           Am
This could be, the first trumpet,
         Dm           Am
might as well, be the last.
     Dm                  Am
Many more, will have to suffer,
     Dm         G       Am         Dm     Am
many more, will have to die, don't ask me why


          Dm             G               Am
Things are not the way, they used to be, I won't tell no lie.
        Dm           G         Am
One and all, have to face reality


          Dm                Am
'Tho I've tried to find the answer
   Dm                     Am
to all the questions they ask.
       Dm                Am
'Tho I know it's impossible
     Dm        G       Am            Dm      Am
to go living through the past, don't tell no lie


          Dm             G                  Am
There's a natural mystic flow thru' the air,

can't keep them down


       Dm             G               Am
if you listen carefully now you will hear.
Am
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
