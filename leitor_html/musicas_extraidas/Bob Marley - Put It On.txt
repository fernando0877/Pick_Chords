Feel them spirit;

Lord, I thank you;

Good Lord, hear me;
Good Lord, hear me.

I'm not boasting;
I'm not boasting;
I'm not boasting, yeah!
Feel like toasting;
Feel like toasting; Simply 'cause:

I'm gonna put it on; (In the morning)
I'm gonna put it on; (In the night)
I'm gonna put it on; (Anytime, anywhere)
Good Lord, help me;
Good Lord, help me.

(Doo-doo doo-doo doo-doo doo);

No more cryin';
No more cryin';
No more cryin'.
Lord, I thank you;
Lord, I thank you.

And I'm gonna put it on;
I'm gonna put it on;
I'm gonna put it on.
Feel all right now;
Feel all right now.
