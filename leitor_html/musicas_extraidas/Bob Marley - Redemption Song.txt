Redemption Song
Bob Marley

     G                 Em
Old pirates, yes, they rob I
C7+                    Am
Sold I to the merchant ships
G                        Em
 Minutes after they took I,
C7+                  Am
 From the bottomless pit

       G          Em
But my haaand was made strong,
C7+                     Am
   By the hand of the Almighty
G                     Em         C       Am
   We forward in, this generation, Triumphantly

C         D       G   /   
Won't you help to sing,   
C         D       G   /   
   These songs of freedom?
       C      D       Em  /   
'Cause all I, ever have,

C     D        G   /  
    Redemption songs (2x)

      G                             Em
Emancipate yourselves, from mental slavery
            C7+                  Am
None but ourselves, can free our minds
        G               Em
Have no fear for atomic energy
               C7+                Am
'Cause none of them, can stop the time

    G                        Em
How long shall they kill our prophets
          C7+            Am
While we stand aside and look? Ooh
     G               Em
Some say it's just a part of it
      C7+                  Am
We've got to full fill the Book
