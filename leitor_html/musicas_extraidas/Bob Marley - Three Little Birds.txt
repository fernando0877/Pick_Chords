Three Little Birds
Bob Marley


      A
Don't worry about a thing
      D                                   A
Cause every little thing, is gonna be all right (2x)


             A
Rise up this morning
            E
Smiled with rising sun, 
             A
Three little birds
              D
Pitched by my doorstep,

Singing sweet songs
            E
Of melodies pure and true
       D          C       /B     A
Saying, this is a message to you uh uh
