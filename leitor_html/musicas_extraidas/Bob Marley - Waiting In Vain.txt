Waiting In Vain

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love (2x)

G7+                            C7+
  From the very first time I blessed, my eyes, on you girl
G7+               C7+
  My heart said follow through
G7+                      C7+
  But I know now that Im way down on your line
G7+                          C7+
  But the waiting feeling's fine

G7+                         C7+
  So don't treat me like, a puppet on a string
G7+                           C7+
  Cause I know how to do my thing
G7+                    C7+
  Don't talk to me, as if you think Im dumb
G7+                               C7+
  I wanna know when you're gonna come, see

G7+                    C7+
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love (3x)

C                 D     Bm                Am
  Cause summer is here, I'm still waiting there
C           D         Bm                Am      G7+ C7+ G7+ C7+
  Winter is here, and I'm still waiting there

G7+         /                      C7+
  it's been three years since I'm, knocking on your door
G7+     /                    C7+
  And I still can knock some more
G7+                 C7+
Ooo girl, Ooo girl, Is it reasonable (I wanna know now)
G7+   /               C7+
  For I to knock some more, you see

G7+  /           C7+
  In life I know, there's lots of grief
G7+        /            C7+
  But your love is my relief
G7+                    C7+
Tears in my eyes burn, Tears in my eyes burn
          G7+                                C7+
While I'm waiting, while I'm waiting, for my turn

G7+                    C7+
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

G7+
I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't wanna
C7+
I don't want no wait in vain
