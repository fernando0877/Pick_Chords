Am            G7            Am
Until the philosophy which holds one race
   G7           Am  G7    Am    G7
Superior, and another  inferior
    Am    G7    Am       G7     Am  G7       Am
Is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned
G7                Am  G7       Am
   Everywhere is war.   Is uh war

G7        Am               G7            Am
  That until there are no longer first class
                  G7              Am    G7
And second class citizens of any nation
Am                    G7           Am             G7
Until the color of a man's skin is of no more significance
                        Am
Than the color of his eyes,  Is uh war

     Am               G7              Am                  G7
That until the basic human rights are equally guaranteed to all
           Am
Without regard to race,  there is a war

G7      Am            G7       Am              G7
   That until that day  the dreams of lasting peace
 Am            G7           Am           G7         Am    G7
World citizenship, and the rule of international morality
        Am                       G7
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion
         Am  G7            Am
To be pursued, but never attained
G7                   Am  G7  Am
  No, everywhere is war.    War

G7     Am          G7  Am         G7
   War in the east.   War in the west
    Am       G7     Am        G7
War up north.  War down south
 Am   G7   Am          G7
War, war. Rumors of a war

G7    Am           G7          Am
  And until the ignoble and unhappy regime that now holds
G7                 Am  G7     Am       G7
Our brothers in Angola,   in Mozambique
      Am     G7     Am          G7
South Africa.  Sub-human bondage
           Am     G7       Am
Have been toppled,  utterly destroyed
 G7                  Am  G7        Am
Well, everywhere is war.    Is uh war

G7     Am          G7  Am         G7
   War in the east.   War in the west
    Am       G7     Am        G7
War up north.  War down south
 Am   G7   Am          G7
War, war. Rumors of a war

G7      Am           G7          Am         G7            Am       G7
  And until that day      the African continent     will not know peace
G7    Am             G7
   We Africans will fight

G7            Am     G7
  We find it necessary

         Am           G7
And we know we shall win
      Am           G7        Am         G7       Am
As we are confident  in the victory of good over evil
G7          Am   G7         Am
  Good over evil. Good over evil
