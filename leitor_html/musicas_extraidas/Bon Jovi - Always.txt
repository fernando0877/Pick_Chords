Always
Bon Jovi

C#m                    B
 This romeo is bleeding but you can't see his blood
A                                         G#   
 It's nothing but some feelings that this old 
          A B C#m
dog kicked up

C#m                                        
 It's been raining since you left me now I'm 
    B
drowning in the flood
A                                          G#  
 You see I've always been a fighter but without
            A B C#m
 you I give up

C#m                                     B
 Now I can't sing a love song like the way it's meant to be
          A                              B       
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore but baby,
               A B
 that's just me

E             B        A C#m B
Yeah, I will love you, Baby always
    E                B           A  C#m B
And I'll be there forever and a day always

E                                              
I'll be there till the stars don't shine till 
    B
the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
            A                                   
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind and 
      B       A B C#m
I'll love you always

            C#m                                  
Now you're pictures that you left behind are just
    B
 memories of a different life
           A                                   
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry 
          G#               B
one that made you have to say goodbye

          C#m                                    
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
     B
 to touch your lips, to hold you near
          A                                      
When you say your prayers try to understand I've 
      G#            A B C#m
made mistakes, I'm just a man

         C#m                                   
When he holds you close when he pulls you near 
         B
when he says the words you've been needing to hear
      A                                         
I'll wish I was him `cause those words are mine 
    B                  A       B
to say to you till the end of time

E             B        A C#m B
Yeah, I will love you, Baby always

    E                B           A  C#m B
And I'll be there forever and a day always
D                   G            A
If you told me to cry for you I could
D                  G       A
If you told me to die for you
    Bm          A           G
I would take a look at my face
             F#m          A
There's no price I won't pay to say these words to you

        A                                      
Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice 
     B
but baby if you give me just one more try
        C#m                                     
We can pack up our old dreams and our old lives 
       A                      B
we'll find a place where the sun still shines

E             B        A C#m B
Yeah, I will love you, Baby always

E                B           A  C#m B
And I'll be there forever and a day always
E                                              
I'll be there till the stars don't shine till 
    B
the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
            A                                   
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind and 
      B       A B C#m
I'll love you always
