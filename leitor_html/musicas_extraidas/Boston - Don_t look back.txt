  A4         A       D           E
Don't look back, a new day is breakin'
      A4        A            D         E
it's been too long since I felt this way.
A4        A         D      E
I don't mind where I get taken,
     A4        A       E           F#m
the road is callin', today is the day.

G              C       D 
I can see, it took so long
          G         C         D              C
just to realize, I'm much too strong not to compromise.
                 Am                D                  E7
Now I see what I am, is holding me down, I'll turn it around...

Am F G                    Dm       G
I    finally see the dawn arrivin'
Am F G                       Dm      G Am
I    see beyond the road I'm drivin'

A4 A D E (2x)

        A4       A          D    E
It's a bright horizon, and I'm awakin' now
      A4     A         D         E
oh I see myself, in a brand new way
     A4       A            D          E
The sun is shinin', the clouds are breakin'
       A4        A               E          F#m
'cause I can't lose now, there's no game to play

G                   C        D       
I can tell, there's no more time left
     G                 C       D             C
to criticize, I've seen what I could not recognize
                  Am                 D                  E
everything in my life, was leading me on, but I can be strong...


Am F G                    Dm       G
I    finally see the dawn arrivin'
Am F G                       Dm
I    see beyond the road I'm drivin'

G                  Am      
Far away, I'm left behind... Left behind
