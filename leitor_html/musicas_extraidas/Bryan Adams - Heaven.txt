Heaven
Bryan Adams

C/E    Am                   G
  Oh   thinking about, our younger years
          Dm            Am
There was only you, and me
         Bb                 G            C
We were young and wild and free
     Am                    G
Now nothing can take, you away from me
           Dm                Am
We've been down, that road before
            Bb     Bb/A
But that's over now
            G
You keep me coming, back for more

F           G          Am
Baby you're all that I want
            C                F
When you're lying here in my arms
F                G       Am            G
I'm finding it's hard believe we're in heaven

    F       G          Am
‘Cos love is all that I need
      C                      F
And I found it there in your heart
    F         G      Am              G
It isn't too hard to see we're in heaven

C/E   Am                       G
   Oh, once in your life, you find someone
         Dm                Am
Who will turn your world around
          Bb                      G    C
Bring you up when you're feelin' down
     Am                          G
Yeah, nothing can change what you mean to me
             Dm                Am
OOh, There's lots that I could say
          Bb        Bb/A
But just hold me now
          G                      (Refrão:)
‘Cos our love will light the way

Dm                  C/E    F
  I've been waiting for so long
     F        G   Am
For something to arrive
                  G/B
For love to come along
C Dm                   C/E      F
    Now our dreams are coming true
                              C
Through the good times and the bad
              Gsus4             G
Yeah, I'll be standing there by you
