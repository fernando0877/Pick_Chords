          D6/9    G6
You don't know me
                        D6/9    G
Bet you'll never get to know me
          D6/9
You don't know me at all, Feel so lonely
The world is spinning round slowly


There's nothing you can
 D6/9          G
show me From behind the wall

Nasci lá na Bahia de mucamba com feitor
O meu pai dormia em cama, minha mãe no pisadô
Laia ladaia sabadana ave maria

Bm             E
Show me from behind the wall 

Laia ladaia sabadana ave maria
Laia ladaia sabadana ave maria
Laia ladaia sabadana ave maria 

Bm              E
Eu agradeço ao povo brasileiro
Bm        E
Norte, centro, sul inteiro
Bm            G
Onde reinou o baião
