I Will Survive
Cake

Am  Dm  G  C  F  B  E7
   Am                        Dm
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
                G7
I kept thinking I could never live
            C
Without you by my side
            F
But then I spent so many nights
              B7
Just thinking how you'd done me wrong
        E                E7
I grew strong, I learned how to get along

    Am                  Dm
And so you're back from outer space
             G7
I just walked in to find you here
             C
Without that look upon your face
              F
I should have changed my fucking lock
             B7
I would have made you leave your key
            E
If I'd have known for just one second
         E7
You'd be back to bother me

   Am                   Dm
Oh now go, Walk out the door |
           G7                    C
Just turn around now, You're not welcome anymore
F7                                B7
 Weren't you the one Who tried to break me with desire?
                  E        
Did you think I'd crumble?
                  E7
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

   Am               Dm
Oh not I, I will survive, yeah
   G7                            C
As long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive
          F                
I've got, all my life to live,
          B7
I've got, all my love to give
  E               E7
I will survive, I will survive|

        Am                                  Dm
It took all the strength I had, Just not to fall apart.
           G7                             C
I'm trying hard to mend, The pieces of my broken heart
            F
And I spent oh so many nights
             B
Just feeling sorry for myself
          E              E7
I used to cry, But now I hold my head up high

    Am                     Dm
And you'll see me with somebody new
             G7                            C
Im not that stupid little person, Still in love with you
           F
And so you thought you'd just drop by
          B7
And you expect me to be free
            E
But now I'm saving all my loving
         E7
For some-one who's loving me
