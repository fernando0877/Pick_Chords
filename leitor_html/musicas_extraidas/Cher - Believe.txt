F                         Fmaj7
No matter how hard I try, you keep pushing me aside
      Bb                              C
and I can't break through, there's no talking to you.
        F                           Am
It's so sad that you're leavin', it takes time to believe it.
Bb                            C
But after all is said and done, you're gonna be the lonely one, oh...
 
F        C                      Gm  Bb
Do you believe in life after love?
      F                C
I can feel something inside me say
  Gm                        Dm
I really don't think you're strong enough now(2x)

 
F                          Fmaj7
What am I supposed to do? Sit around and wait for you,
        Bb                        C
well I can't do that, and there's no turnin' back.
       F                       Am
I need time to move on, I need love to feel strong,
Bb                                   
'cos I've had time to think it through,
C
'n maybe I'm too good for you, oh...

Dm                          C         Dm                       C
Well I know that I'll get through this, 'cos I know that I am strong.
            Bb                        C
And I don't need you anymore, I don't need you anymore.
        Bb              Gm           C
I don't need you anymore, no I don't need you anymore.
