Tennessee Whiskey
Chris Stapleton

A                            Bm
Used to spend my nights at a barroom
                              A    A4  A
Liquor was the only love I've known  
A                                        Bm
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom
                                       A   A4 A
And brought me back from being too far gone  

          /                        Bm
You're as smooooooth, as Tennessee whiskey
          /                        A   A4 A
You're as sweeeeeeet as strawberry wine  
          /                        Bm
You're as waaaarrrrm as a glass of brandy
                 /              /            A   A4 A
And honey I stay stoned on your love all the time  

A                                        Bm
Iâ€™ve looked for love in all the same old places god
          /                             A      A4 A
Found the bottom of the bottle's always drrryyy  
         /                                   Bm
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
            /                 /              A           
Cause there nothing, like your love to get me hiiiiigggh. You're as
