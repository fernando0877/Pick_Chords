Johnny B. Goode
Chuck Berry

     Bb5
Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods, among the evergreens
        Eb5
There stood a log cabin, made of earth and wood
      Bb5
Where lived a country boy, named Johnny B. Goode
     F5
Who never ever learned, to read or write so well
             Bb5
But he could play a guitar, just like a-ringin' a bell

        Bb5
Go, go,     go Johnny go
                 Eb5
Go, go Johnny go
                 Bb5
Go, go Johnny go
                 F5
Go, go Johnny go
              Bb5
Go Johnny B. Goode

            Bb5
He used to carry his guitar, in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree, by the railroad track
        Eb5
Oh! The engineers would see, him sittin' in the shade
  Bb5
Strummin' with the rhythm, that the drivers made
 F5
People passing by, they would stop and say
     Bb5
Oh, myyyy  but that little, country boy can play

     Bb5
His mama told him someday, you will be a man
And you will be the leader, of a big old band
Eb5
Many people coming, from miles around
   Bb5
To hear you play your music, 'till the sun go down
 F5
Maybe someday your name, will be in the lights
       Bb5
Sayin' Johnny B. Goode tonight
