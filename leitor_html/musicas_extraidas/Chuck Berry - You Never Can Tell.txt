It was a teenage wedding, and the old folks, they wished them well.
                                                       G
You could see, that Pierre, did truly, love the mademoiselle.
             G7                
And now, the young, monsieur and madame, have rung, the chapel bell,
                                      G7                           C    G

They furnished off an apartment, with a two room, Roe buck sale.
                                                       G
The coolerator was crammed, with TV dinners and ginger ale.

But when Pierre, found work, the little money, comin' worked out well.
                                       G7                        C    G

They had a hi-fi phono, oh boy, did they let it blast.
Seven hundred, little records, all rock and rhythm and jazz.
But when the sun, went down, the rapid tempo of the music fell.
'C'est la vie', say the old folks, it goes to show, you never can tell.

They bought, a souped-up jitney, was a cherry red fifthy three.
They drove it down New Orleans, to celebrate their anniversary.
It was there, where Pierre, was married to the lovely madamoiselle.
C'est la vie', say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell.
