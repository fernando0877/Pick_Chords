Put Your Records On
Corinne Bailey Rae

G                   A7
Three little birds, sat on my window
C/D                                 G
  And they told me, I don't need to worry
G                     A7
Summer came like cinnamon, So sweet,
C/D                                 G
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Em7     B7/D#          Em7                         A9
Maybe sometimes, we've got it wrong, but it's alright
     C7+                               Cm7+
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same

Oh, don't you hesitate

G                          A7/E
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
C/D                       G
You go ahead, let your hair down
G                         A7/E
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
C/D                        G
Just go ahead, let your hair down
C7+                            Cm7+         G
     You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

G                A7
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely,
C/D                              G
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside
G                           A7
Don't you let those other boys fool you,
C/D                        G
Got to love that afro hair do

Em7     B7/D#          Em7                 A9
Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it's alright
     C7+                               Cm7+
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change

Don't you think it's strange?

Am7
'Twas more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Em                                                   Am7
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
                                             G/B    C7+    Am7
