Born Under A Bad Sign
Cream

Em
Born under a bad sign.
I've been down, since I began to crawl
B7
 If it wasn't for bad luck,
A7
  I wouldn't have, no luck at all.
-------

Em
Bad luck and trouble's my, only friend.
I've been down, ever since, I was ten.
Chorus:

Em
You know, wine and women is all I crave.
A big bad woman's gonna carry me to my grave.
Chorus / Solo:

Em
Bad luck and trouble's my, only friend.
I've been down, ever since, I was ten.
Chorus:

If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck.
If it wasn't for real bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all.
