In a white room    with black curtains,   near the stations

Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings,

Silver horses, run down moonbeams, in your dark eyes.

Dawnlight smiles, on your leaving, my contentment.

      C             G             Bb          A
I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines.
 C            G                Bb     C         D
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves


You said no strings, could secure you, at the stations

Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.

I walked into, such a sad time, at the station.

As I walked out felt, my own need, just beginning

     C             G             Bb          A
I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
I'll wait for you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party, she was kindness, in the hard crowd

Consolation, from the old wound, now forgotten
Yellow tigers, crouched in jungles, in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings
I'll sleep, in this place with, the lonely crowd,
Lie in the dark< where the shadows, run from themselves
