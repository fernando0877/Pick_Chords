Born On The Bayou
Creedence

    E7
Now when, I was just, a little boy,
Standing to my Daddy's knee,

My pappa said, Son don't let, the man get you 
Dooo, whatâ€™e, done me,

/'Cause he'll get you,
/'Cause he'll get you now, now

E7
I can remember, the fourth, of July,
Running through, the backwood, bare

And I can still hear, my hound dog barking

E7                         D A  E7
chasing down, a hoodoo there (2x)

E7              D A E7
Born on a bayou (3x)

Wish I was back, on the Bayou.
Rolling with some, Cajun Queen.

Wishing, I were, a fast, freight train,
Just a choogling, on down, to New Orleans


E7
Born On The Bayou (3x)
