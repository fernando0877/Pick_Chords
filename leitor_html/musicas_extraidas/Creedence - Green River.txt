Green River
Creedence

E7
Well, take me back down, where cool water flows
Let me remember, things I love
Stoppin at the log, where catfish bite
C
Walkin along, the river road, at night
A                                    E7
Barefoot girls, daancing, in the moonlight

E
I can hear the bullfrog, calling me
Wonder if my ropes, still hangin to the tree
Love to kick my feet, way down, the shallow water
C
Shoe fly dragon, fly get, back tyour mother
A                                          E7  
Pickup a, flat rock, skip it across, green river
E7   ///   C  A
Well

E
Lovers codys camp, I spent my daaays
With flat car riders, and cross,tie walkers
Old cody june, you took me over,
C
Said, youâ€™re gonna find, the world, is smouldrin.
A                                       E7
if you get lost, come on home, to green river
