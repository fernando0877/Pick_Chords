I Heard It Through The Grapevine
Creedence

Dm                          Dm 
Bet you're wondering how I knew 
            A7               G
'bout your plans, to make me blue
                Dm
With some other guuuuuy, that you knew before.
                  A7                         G
Between two of us guys, you know, I love you more.
                 Bm                 G  
It took me by surpriiiiiise, I must say, 
        Dm               G
when I found out  yesterday.

     Dm                           
Oo I Heard it, through the grapevine 
         G
not much longer, would you be mine
     Dm 
Oo I heard it, through the grapevine,
        G
and I'm just, about to lose, my mind, 
Honey, honey yeah

                Dm                       
You know that a man, ain't supposed to cry
           A7                       G
but these tears, I can't hold inside.
       Dm                          
Losin' you would end my life you see,
           A7                   G
cause you mean that much to me.
               Bm            G 
You could have told me yourself,
         Dm             G
that you found someone else.
    
                     Dm                
People say believe half of what you see,
          A7               G
son, and none of what you hear.
        Dm                          A7                       G
I can't help bein' confused if it's true please tell me dear?
       Bm             G
Do you plan to let me go
               Dm                  G
for the other guy that you knew before?
