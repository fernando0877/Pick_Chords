G                        C              G
Just about a year ago, I set out on the road.
                    Em           C                   D
Seekin' my fame and fortune, I'm looking for a pot of gold.
G               Em                  C                 G
Things got bad, things got worse, I guess you know the tune,
             D              C      G
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

  G                             C                    G
I boarded on the Greyhound, I'm walking there by the road
                   Em                  C               D
I was just passing through, it must be seven months or more.
  G                   Em        C                    G
I ran out of time and money, it looks like, two were friends
             D              C      G   (G  C)
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

  G                        C                G
A man from a magazine, who said I was on my way
                   Em          C                   D
Somewhere I lost connection, I ran out of songs to play
  G                     Em                 
I planned many times of one-night stands
   C                        G
it looks like my plans fell through
             D              C      G
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again

A                            D               A
  If I only had a dollar for every song I've sung.
                F#m                D                    E
Or every time I had to play while people slapped their tongue.
  A                   F#m          D               A
I know I'll catch the next train, back to where I live.
             E               D   A
Oh Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again
