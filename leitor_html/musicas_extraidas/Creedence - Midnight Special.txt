Midnight Special
Creedence

D                           G                                D
 Well, you wake up, in the morning, You hear, the work bell ring
                             A7                          D
 And they march you, to the table, You see the same old thing

D                       G                              D
Ain't no food, upon the table, And no fork up, in the pan
                             A7                                  D
But you better, not complain boy, Youll get in trouble, with the man

                 G                          D
Let the midnight special,Shine the light on me
                 A7                         D 
Let the midnight special,Shine the light on me
                 G                          D
Let the midnight special,Shine the light on me
                 A7                               D 
Let the midnight special,Shine ever loving light on me


Yonder come Miss Rosie, How the world did you know
By the way she wears her apron, And the clothes she wore
Umbrella on her shoulder, Piece of paper in her hand
She come to see the gov'nor, She wanna free her man

If you're ever in Houston,Ooh, you'd better do right
You'd better not gamble, And you'd better not fight
Or the sheriff will grab you,And the boys'll bring you down
The next thing you know, boy,Ooh, you're prison-bound
