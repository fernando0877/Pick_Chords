Deja Vu
Crosby, Stills and Nash

Gm
If I had 
ever been here 
before 
I would probably know 
just what to do

Don't you?

If I had ever 
been here before 
on another time around the wheel 
I would probably know just how to deal 
With all of you

      E
And I feel
Like I've been 
here before

Feeeeel 
Like I've been 
here before
        G
And you know
           Bm
It makes meee wonder
       /D
What's going on 
under
     F#m
the ground

       Em
Do you know?
Don't you wonder?
What's going on 
down under you.

We have all been here before
We have all been here before
We have all been here before
We have all been here before
