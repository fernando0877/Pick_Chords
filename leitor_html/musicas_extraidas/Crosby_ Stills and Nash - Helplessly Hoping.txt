Helplessly Hoping
Crosby, Stills and Nash

Am7                    C  
Helplessly hoping, Her harlequin 
          G                D
hovers nearby, Awaiting a word
Am7                     C
Gasping at glimpses, Of gentle, true spirit
    G                      D
He runs, wishing he could fly-y
        Am7          C              G    D
Only to trip, at the sound, of good-byyyyye

Am                      C 
Wordlessly watching, He waits 
                   G
by the window, and wonders
                      D
At the empty, place inside

Am7                     C
Heartlessly help,ing himself 
                     G  
to her bad dreams He worries 
                   D     
Did he hear, good-bye-y?



   Am   C        G    C/G 
Or eveeeeeen, hellooooo? 
         G     C/G
They are ooone person, 
         G    C/G            G       C/G
they are two alone, they are three together, 
         G    F   C       G      C/G    G
they are foooooor,     each other



Am                             C
Stand by the stair, way you'll see something
           G                           D
certain to tell you, confusion has its cost
Am                     C
Love isn't lying, It's loose 
               G                      D
in a lady, who lingers, Saying she is lo-ost
