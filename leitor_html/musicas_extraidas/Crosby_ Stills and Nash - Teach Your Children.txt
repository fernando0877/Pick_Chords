Teach Your Children
Crosby, Stills and Nash

D  G   D   A
D                  G
You who are on the road
            D                 A       A4  A
Must have a code that you can live by
    D             G
And so become yourself
            D              A      A4  A
Because the past is just a good-bye

D                   G
Teach your children well
               D               A     A4  A
Their father's hell did slowly go by
    D                 G
And feed them on your dreams
             D                       A     A4  A
The one they picked's the one you'll know by

D                       G                               D
Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you will cry
                         Bm  G
So just look at them and sigh
A             D        G  D  A
And know they love you

    D              G
And you, of tender years
               D                      A     A4  A
Can't know the fears that your elders grew by
       D                          G
And so please help them with your youth
              D                 A       A4  A
They seek the truth before they can die

D                  G
Teach your parents well
                 D                A     A4  A
Their children's hell will slowly go by
    D                 G
And feed them on your dreams
             D                       A       A4  A
The one they picked's the one you'll know by

D                       G                               D
Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you will cry
                         Bm  G
So just look at them and sigh
A             D       G  D  A
And know they love you
