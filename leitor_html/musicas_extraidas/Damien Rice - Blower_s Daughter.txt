Blower’s Daughter

And so it is
                     A9
Just like you said it would be
             B11
Life goes easy on me
A9          E
Most of the time

          E
And so it is
              A9
The shorter story
              B11
No love, no glory
                 C#m
No hero in her sky

                A
I can't take my eyes off of you
                G#m
I can't take my eyes off you
                F#m
I can't take my eyes off of you
                E
I can't take my eyes off you
                A9            B11
I can't take my eyes off you
                A9      B11  E
I can't take my eyes...

E
And so it is
                      A9     
Just like you said it should be
                           B11
We'll both forget the breeze
A9          E
Most of the time

E
And so it is
E                A9
The colder water
A9                 B11
The blower's daughter
               C#m
The pupil in denial

ohhh , Did I say that I love you?
                 G#m  
Did I say that I want to
C#              D#m
Leave it all behind?

                B
I can't take my mind off of you
                Bbm
I can't take my mind off you
                G#m
I can't take my mind off of you
                F#
I can't take my mind off you
                B        C#
I can't take my mind off you
                B      F#
I can't take my mind...
