(Gaita G, 4a)

D                   G
I, I wish you could swim
         D                           G
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

       C                                D
Though nothing, nothing, will keep us together
       Am       Em              D
We can beat them,  for ever and ever
             C      G              D   (D  G)(2x)
Oh we can be heroes,  just for one day

D            G 
I, I will be king
    D                G
And you, you will be queen

       C                       D
Though nothing, will drive us away
          Am    Em              D
We can be heroes,  just for one day
          C   G             D
We can be us,  just for one day

D          G
I, I can remeeeeember
 D                G
Standing...by the wall
        D           G
And the guns, shot above our heads
       D                               G
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall

        C                   D
And the shame... was on the other side
          Am         Em            D
Oh we can beat them,  for ever and ever
                 C      G             D   
Then we could be heroes, just for one day


D           G 
  we can be heroes,
