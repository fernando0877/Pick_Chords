David Bowie

D                           E
  You've got your mother    in a whirl
  She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
  Hey babe                your hairs alright
  Hey babe                let's go out tonight
  You like   me    and     I like it all
  We like dancing  and    we look divine
  You love bands   when they play it hard
  You want more   and    you  want it fast

A                           D                 Bm     
  They put you down    they  say I'm wrong       You 
                E
tacky thing you put them on

D                           E
   Rebel   Rebel       you've  torn you're dress
   Rebel   Rebel       your face is a mess
   Rebel   Rebel       how could they know?

D                           E
   Hot tramp                I    love you so

D                       E
You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dues

D          E
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?

D           E
So what you wanna know
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you? Looks like you've been there
too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh, how could they know?
Eh, eh
