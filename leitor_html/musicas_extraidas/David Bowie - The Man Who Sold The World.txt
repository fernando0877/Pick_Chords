The Man Who Sold The World
David Bowie

capo 4, tom C#m, 

Am (42, 40, 42, 43,) /  C /

Am                    E7                        Am
  We passed upon the stair, We spoke of was and when
                   E                        C
Although I wasn't there, He said I was his friend
                     G          G7            E7
Which came as some surprise, I spoke into his eyes,
                    Am                      G7
I thought you died alone, A long long time ago



    G          C           Ab           C
Who knows, not me, I (We) never lost control
       G        C             Ab                     E7
You're face to face, With the man who sold the world



Am                      E       E7                Am
I laughed and shook his hand, I made my way back home
  Am                    E                           C
I searched for form and land, For years and years i roamed
                  G         G7              E7
I gazed a gazely stare, at all the millions here,
                   Am                      G
We must have died alone ,A long long time ago
