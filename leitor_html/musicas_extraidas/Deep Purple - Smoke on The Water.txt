   Gm
We all, came out, to Montreux
       /      F    Gm
On the lake Geneva shoreline

Gm                        /
  To make records, with a mobile
F            Gm
   We didn't have much time

Gm         /           /       /
  Oh Frank Zappa & the Mothers
     /           F     Gm
Were at the best place around
Gm          /             /        /
  But some stupid with a flare gun
/                F       Gm
Burned the place to the ground

C            Ab7+
  Smoke on the water
 Gm
Fire in the sky
  C            Ab7+
Smoke on the water

Gm
   They burned down the gambling house
                F      Gm
It died with an awful sound

Funky & Claude was running in and out
F           Gm
   Pulling kids out of the ground

When it all was over
                F      Gm
We had to find another place
Swiss time was running out
                        F            Gm
It seemed that we would loose the race

Gm
   We ended up at the Grand Hotel
       F       Gm
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling Trucks Stones
Thing just outside
F               Gm
   We made our music there

With a few red lights an' a few old beds
            F        Gm
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
       F                Gm
I know,   I know we'll never forget
