Enjoy the silence
Depeche mode

(voz 5a) capo 3, tom Cm

Am                    Cm  
   Words like violence, Break the silence
F
  Come crashing in, Into my little world


Am                Cm  
   Painful to me,  Pierce right through me
F
  Can't you understand, Oh my little girl

Dm                  F
  All I ever wanted, All I ever needed
   Am      C     
Is here in my arms, 
Dm               F
  Words are very unnecessary
Am              G#     
They, can only, do-uh harm

Am   C   (4x)


Am               Cm
  Vows are spoken, To be broken
F
  Feelings are intense, Words are trivial

Am                  Cm
  Pleasures reeemain, So does the pain
F
  Words are meaningless, And forgettable
