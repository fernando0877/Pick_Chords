        E                                   F#m
All the late night bargains have been struck
            B         C#m         B/D#      C#/E#
Between the satin beaus and their belles
F#m                       
Prehistoric garbage trucks
         D9
Have the city to themselves

E                          F#m
Echoes and roars, dinosaurs
            B         C#m         B/D#      C#/E#
They're all doing the monster mash
    F#m
And most of the taxis, most of the whores
    D9
Are only taking calls for cash

A                   B       B/A
I don't know how it happened
   E/G#                 Aadd9  A
It all took place so quick
    E/B        E  F#m  B    C#m  B/A
But all I can do is hand it to you

              E                     F#m
Well, now, my door was standing open
  B      C#m               B/D#  C#/E#
Security was laid back and lax
           F#m
But it was only my heart got a-broken
                    D9
You must have had a pass key made out of wax
           E                     
You played robbery with insolence
                 F#m                 B     C#m        B/D#  C#/E#
And I played the blues in twelve bars down on Lover's Lane
        F#m
And you never did have the intelligence to use
           D9
The twelve keys hanging off of my chain

A                   B       B/A
I don't know how it happened

Well, now, it's past last call for alcohol
     B          C#m               B/D#  C#/E#
Past recall has been here and gone
    F#m
The landlord he finally paid us all
          D9
The satin jazzmen have put away their horns
          E                                  F#m
And we're standing outside of this wonderland
B          C#m             B/D#     C#/E#
Looking so bereaved and so bereft
       F#m
Like a Bowery bum when he finally understands
             D9
The bottle's empty and there's nothing left

A                   B       B/A
I don't know how it happened
       E/G#                         Aadd9 A
It was faster than the eye could flick
    E/B        E  F#m  B    C#m  B/A
But all I can do is hand it to you
