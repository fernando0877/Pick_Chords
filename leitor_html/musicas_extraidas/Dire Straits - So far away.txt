So far away
Dire Straits
Key: E

E                           B
 I here, i am again in this mean old town
                   E
 and you're so far away from me
                            B
 and where are you when the sun goes down
               E
 you're so far away from me

A         C#m        B          E
 so far away from me,  so far i just can see
A         C#m          B          A        E
 so far away from me,  you're so far from me

E                               B
 i'm tired of being in love and being all alone
                    E
 when you're so far away from me
                                B
 i'm tired of making out on the telephone
                    E
-and you're so far away from me---

E                       B
 i get so tired when i have to explain
                    E
 when you're so far away from me
                                 B
 see you're been in the sun i've been in the rain
                E
 you're so far away from me
