Sultans of Swing
Dire Straits
Key: Dm

          Am
You get a shiver in the dark
     G              F        E7
It's raining in the park but meantime
Am                            G         F       E7
  South of the river you, stop’and you hold everything
C                                G         C G
 A band is blowing Dixie, double four time
F                  /                   /          Am    F  G
 You feel alright, right when you hear that music ring

Am              Am                  G        F        E7
  Well now, you step inside,but you dont see too many faces
Am                     G                F        E7
 Coming in out of, the rain to hear the jazz, go down
C                     G     
 Competition in other places
F                                 Am
 oh But the horns, be blowing that sound
F  G              F G                  Am         F  
   Way on downsouth , way on downsouth london town

Am          Am                G F         E7
  You check out guitar George,   he knows all the cords
Am        /       G          F                   E7
 But hes strictly rhythm, He doesnt wanna mak’it cry or sing
C             /              G             /
  They say an old, guitar is all, he can afford
F                                          Am    /  F G
 When he gets’up under lights, to play his thing

Am    /             G    F            E7
  And Harry doesn't mind, if he doesnt, make the scene
Am                   G   F               E7
  He's got a daytime job, he's doing all right
C                             G
 He can play honky tonk, like anything
F                             Am
 Saving it up, for friday night
F G                 F G                    Am    G  F  G  C  G
   With the sultans... with the sultans of swing

      Am
And a crowd of young boys
        G        F            E7
They're fooling around in the corner
Am                                G             F       E7
 Drunk and dressed, in their best brown baggies & their platform soles
C      /            /               G
  They don't give a damn, about any trumpet, playing band
F                                   Am
  It ain't what they call, rock and roll

F G                F G                              Am    G  F  G  C  
   And the sultans... yeah the sultans, they played creole ...creole

Am                  G           F          E7
  Then the man, he steps, right up, to the microphone
Am            G                 F         E7
  And says at last, just as the time bell rings
C                     G
  Goodnight, now it's time, to go home
F                                     Am
  And he makes it fast, with one more thing
F G                   F G                       Am    G  F  G  C  G
    We are the sultans... we are the sultans of swing'
