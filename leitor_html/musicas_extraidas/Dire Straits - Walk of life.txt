Here comes Johnny, singing oldies Goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay

A
  He got the action, He got the motion
E
  Yeah the boy can play
A
  Dedication, devotion
 E
Turning all the night time into the day

           E                           B7
He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
           E                   A
He do the song about the knife
           E    B                    A
He do the walk,   he do the walk of life
 B                       E (E  A  B  A,  B  E)
Yeah, he do the walk of life

 E
Here comes Johnny and he'll tell you the story
Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat the talkin' blues
