Why Worry
Dire Straits

D    A7                             D
baby, i see this world has made you sad
A7  /                  D
    some people can be bad 
G              E                   A7  Bm   C#m
  things the-y do, the things they say

    D    A7                            D
but baby,  i'll wipe away those bitter tears 
A7                              D
 i'll chase away those restless fears 
G                E               A7
  that turn your blue skies into grey  

    D      G                A7              D
Why wor-ry, there should be laughter, after pain
G                 A7             D
  there should be sunshine after rain
G                   A7              D
  these things have always been the same

G       A7    D
 so why worry now?
G    A7     D    G  A7
 why worry now?    

D    A7                           D  
baby, when i get down, i turn to you
A7                            D
 and you make sense of what i do
G           E)           A7
  I know it isnt hard to say 

      D A7                                    D
but baby, just when this world seems mean and cold
A7                /               D
  our love comes shining red and gold 
G             E              A7
  and all the rest is by the way
