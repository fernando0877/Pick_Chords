What´cha know about love
    /              G
You said our, love would be
    /              C
You said you were, my girlfriend
     /               G
Some girl you turned out to be

  /               C
I guess you know about, leaving
              G
Loving and leaving me
                C
You left me for no, reason
        /          G
But you lead me to believe

Em                F          G
   Sometimes your life, I can crumble
Em                F                    G
   Sometimes your soul, might make you, stumble
Em               F               G
   But you can´t drowned in your sorrow
           Em              F                 G
‘cause you might be found, might be found, tomorrow

               C
What´cha know about, leaving
         /         G
When you be treated like a queen
      /                 C
But a queen don´t know about, giving
        /          G
I ain´t looking to receive
