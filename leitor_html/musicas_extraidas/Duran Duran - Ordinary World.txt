 C#m                          E          F#
Came in from a rainy thursday on the avenue
C#m                                  E  F#
    Thought I heard you talking softly
C#m                            E           F#
I turned on the lights, the tv and the radio
C#m                                   E  F#
    Still Ican't escape the ghost of you

C#m7                           G#m          G#m9
What has happened to it all? Crazy, some'd say
  D#7                          E
Where is the life that I recognize?, Gone away

B                           F#m                      D7M            A/C#       E
  But I won't cry for yesterday, There's an ordinary world, Somehow I have to find
B                         F#m                  D7M          A/C#        E
  And as I try to make my way, To the ordinary world, I will learn to survive

C#m                          E              F#
Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
C#m                               E  F#
    Pride will tear us both apart
           C#m                                 E             F#
Well now pride's gone out the window cross the Rooftops run away
C#m                              E   F#
    Left me in the vacuum of my heart

  C#m                 G#m           G#m9
What happening to me? Crazy, some'd say
  D#7                           E
Where is my friend when I need you most? Gone away

 C#m                            E              F#
Papers in the roadside, Tell of suffering and greed
 C#m                          E  F#
Feared today, forgot tomorrow
         C#m                           E            F#
Ooh, here    besides the news, Of holy war and holy need
C#m                             E    F#
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

       B  F#m            D9 
Every woooooooorld is my world
         A/C#        E
(I will learn to survive)
