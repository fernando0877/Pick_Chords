Electric Avenue
Eddy Grant

A
Down in the street there is violence
And a lots of work to be done
No place to hang out our washing
And I can't blame all on the sun, oh no

We gonna rock down to, Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher  (2x)

Workin' so hard like a soldier
Can't afford a thing on TV
Deep in my heart I'm a warrior
Can't get food for them kid, good God

Who is to blame in one country
Never can get to the one
Dealing in multiplication
And they still can't feed everyone

Out in the street, Out in the street
Out in the playground, In the dark side of town
Out in the street, Out in the street
Out in the daytime, Out in the night
