You're the apple of my eye,

I scream it to the nothingness,

There ain't nothing that I need.

Chocolate candy, Jesus Christ,

Moats and boats and waterfalls,

Alley-ways and pay phone calls,

That's true,
Bm
We laugh until we think we'll die,
D
Barefoot on a summer night

Nothin' new is sweeter than with you

And in the streets you run afree,

Like it's only you and me,
