Well, it's one for the money, two for the show

Three to get ready, now go, cat, go

             C7                         G
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
              D7
You can do anything
 C7                                G  D
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

G
Well, you can knock me down, step in my face

Slander my name all over the place

Do anything that you wanna do
                     D7
But, uh, uh, honey, lay off of my shoes

                     C7
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes
                      G
Well, you can do anything

But lay off of my blue suede shoes

G
You can burn my house, steal my car

Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar

Do anything that you wanna to do

But, uh, uh, honey, lay off of my shoes

                            G
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes

You can do anything

Well, it's one for the money, two for the show

Three to get ready, now go, cat, go

But don't you step on my blue suede shoes

You can do anything
                          G
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

Blue, blue, blue suede shoes

Blue, blue, blue suede shoes

You can do anything

But lay off of my blue suede shoes
