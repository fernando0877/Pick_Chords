 D            G          A           D
Lord almighty i feel my temperature rising
 D                G               A           D
Higher and higher it's burning through to my soul
 D              G            A         D
Girl girl girl you're gonna set me on fire
 D                  G              A           D
My brain is flaming i don't know which way to go

 Bm          A          G
'Cause your kisses lift me higher
       Bm          A      G
Like the sweet song of a choir
 Bm           A        G
And you light my morning sky
      A       D
With burning love

D           G          A           D
Ooh ooh ooh i feel my temperature rising
 D                  G       A           D
Help me i'm flaming i must be a hundred and nine
 D             G          A           D
Burnin burnin burnin and nothing can cool me
D                  G        A     D
I just might turn to smoke but i feel fine

 Bm          A          G
'Cause your kisses lift me higher
       Bm          A      G
Like the sweet song of a choir
 Bm           A        G
And you light my morning sky
      A       D
With burning love

( Bm  A  G  Bm )
( A  G  Bm  A  G )

      A       D
With burning love
D                    G        A            D
It's coming closer the flames are licking my body
 D                G           A            D
Won't you help me i feel like i'm slipping away
D                    G       A     D
It's hard to breath my chest is a heaving
 D               G             A           D
Lord have mercy, i'm burning a hole where I lay

Bm          A          G
'Cause your kisses lift me higher
       Bm          A      G
Like the sweet song of a choir
 Bm           A        G
And you light my morning sky
      A       D
With burning love

D                          G
I'm a hunka hunka burning love
D                          G
I'm a hunka hunka burning love
D                          G
I'm a hunka hunka burning love
D                          G
