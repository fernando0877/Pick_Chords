Don't Be Cruel
Elvis Presley


 D
 You know I can be found
 Sittin' all alone
 G
 If you can't come around
 D
 At least please telephone
        Em   A7                     D
 Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

  D
 Baby if I made you mad
 With something I might have said
   G
 Please let's forget the past
      D
 The future looks bright ahead
        Em   A7                     D
 Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
          G             A7
 I don't want no other love
  G              A7              D
 Baby it's just you I'm thinking of

  D
 Don't stop thinking of me
 Don't make me feel this way
      G
 Come on over here and love me
       D
 You know what I want you to say

        Em7      A7                 D
 Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
   G              A7
 Why should we be a part
    G                A7             D
 I really love you, Baby, cross my heart

        D
 Let's walk up to the preacher
 And let us say, "I do,"
   G
 Then you'll know you have me
         D
 And I know that I'll have you

        Em7      A7                 D

 Baby it's just you I'm thinking of

        Em7      A7                 D
 Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
        Em7      A7                 D
 Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
