Am
Never know how much I love you
Am
Never know how much I care
Am
When you put your arms around me
         E7                      Am
I get a, fever that's so hard to bear

                   Am
You give me fever, when you kiss me
F#                     Am
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever - in the morning
          E7          Am
Fever all through the night

Am
Sun lights up the daytime
Am
Moon lights up the night
Am
I light up when you call my name
        E7                       Am
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

                   Am
You give me fever, when you kiss me
F#                Am
Fever when you hold me tight
Am
Fever - in the morning
          E7          Am
Fever all through the night



Am
Everybody's got the fever
Am
That is something you all know
Am
Fever isn't such a new thing
E7                  Am
Fever started long a---go

Am
Romeo loved juliet
Am
Juliet she felt the same
Am
When he pout his arms around her, he said
        E7              Am
"julie, baby, you're my flame.

                   Am
Thou givest fever, when we kisseth
F#                     Am
Fever when thy flaming youth

Fever - I'm a fire
       E7            Am
Fever, yea I burn forsooth

Captain smith and pocahantas
Am
Had a very mad affair
Am
When her daddy tried to kill him, she said
      E7           Am
"daddy-o don't you dare."

                   Am
He gives me fever, with his kisses
F#                     Am
Fever when he holds me tight
Am
Fever - I'm his missus
         E7                  Am
Oh daddy won't you treat him right

Am
Now you've listened to my story
Am
Here's a point that I have made
Am
Chicks were born to give you fever
      E7            Am
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade

                     Am
They give you fever, when you kiss them
F#                    Am
Fever if you live and learn
        E7                  Am
Fever - 'til you sizzle

Am
What a lovely way to burn
Am
What a lovely way to burn
Am
What a lovely way to burn
