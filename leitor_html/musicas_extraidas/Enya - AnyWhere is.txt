  D                D/F#
I walk the maze of moments
    G            D/F#
But everywhere I turn to
   G           D/F#
Begins a new beginning
    A             D
But never finds a finish

I walk to the horizon
And there I find another
It all seems so surprising
And then I find that I know

Bm                   A/C#
You go there, you're gone forever
  G/D            A/E
I go there, I'll lose my way

   Bm                  A/C#
If we stay here, we're not together
G/D      A
Anywhere is


The moon upon the ocean
Is swept around in motion
But without ever knowing
The reason for its flowing

In motion on the ocean
The moon still keeps on moving
The waves still keep on waving
And I still keep on going

Chorus

I wonder if the stars sign
The life that is to be mine
And would they let their light shine
Enough for me to follow

I look up to the heavens
But night has clouded over
No spark of constellation
No Vela no Orion
