A Little Respect
Erasure

             C
I try to discover
                       G
A little something, to make me sweeter
        E                          F
Oh baby refrain,  from breaking my heart
------
           C                       G
I'm so in love with you, I'll be forever blue
                     F
That you give me, no reason
                      Am
Why you're making me, work so hard

 G
That you give me no(4x)

 C               Am
Soul, I hear you calling
          F                      Em    F G    C
Oh baby please, give a little respect, toooo me

----------
                 C
And if, I should falter
                     G
Would you open, your arms out to me
            G        E
We can make love not war
            G              F
And live at peace with our hearts
 

           C                       G
I'm so in love with you, I'll be forever blue
                   F
What religion or reason
                          Am
Could drive a man, to for sake his lover

 G
