Ain't had no lovin', Since you been gone




Alberta Alberta, Where'd you stayed last night

Alberta Alberta, Where'd you stayed last night

Come home this morning, Clothes don't fit you right



Alberta Alberta, Girl you're on my mind

Alberta Alberta, Girl you're on my mind

Ain't had no lovin', Such a great long time
