Blues before sunrise
Eric Clapton

           C#7
I have the blues, before sunrise,
Tears standing in, my eyes.
           F#7
I have the blues before sunrise,
                       C#7
Tears standing in, my eyes.
        G#7
It was a miserable feeling my babe,
            F#7   C#7
A feeling I do despise.

          C#7
I have to leave, leave you baby,
Because you know you, done me wrong.
          F#7
I have to leave you baby
                              C#7
Because you know you, done me wrong
              G#7
I'm gonna pack up, and leave you darling
          F#7          C#7
And break up, my happy home.

          C#7
I have to leave, leave you baby,
I'm gonna leave you, all alone.
          F#7
I'm gonna leave you baby,
                          C#7
I'm gonna leave you, all alone.
               G#7                    
I'm gonna pack up and leave you darling
F#7                              C#7
    Because you know you, done me wrong.

         C#7
Well now goodbye, goodbye baby,
I'll see you on some, rainy day.
         F#7
Well now goodbye baby,
                            C#7
I'll see you on some, rainy day.
                 G#7
You can go ahead now, little darling,
F#7                               C#7
  'Cause I want you to, have your way.
