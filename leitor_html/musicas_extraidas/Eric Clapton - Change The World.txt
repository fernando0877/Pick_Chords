Change The World

E             A9/E       D6/E
  If I could reach the stars
D6/E        A9/E     E
  Pull one down for you
E          A9/E   D6/E
  Shine it on my heart
D6/E            A9/E     E
  So you could see the truth
A            D9/A       G6/A
  That this love I have inside
G6/A      D9/A    A
Is everything it seems
E          A9/E  D6/E
  But for now I find
D6/E        A9/E   G#7
  It's only in my dreams

          F#m7   G#7         C#m7
And I can      chaaaange the world
D#m7(5-)    G#7             C#m7
I'd be the sunlight in your universe
 D#m7(5-)       G#7
You'd think my love was really
 C#m7   Cm7   Bm7
Some__thing  good
 E    A7    E
Baby, if I could
   G#m7  Gm7    F#m7
Chan_______ge      the world

E       A9/E     D6/E
  If I could be king
D6/E    A9/E  E
  Even for a day
E              A9/E    D6/E
  I'd take you as my queen
D6/E           A9/E     E
  I'd have it no other way
A          D9/A       G6/A
  And our love would rule in this
G6/A       D9/A    A
  Kingdom we have made
E                A9/E  D6/E
  Till then I'd be a  fool
D6/E       A9/E    G#7
  Wishin' for the day

      A7    E
Baby, if I could
  G#m7     Gm7       F#m7
Change the     world
      A7    E
Baby, if I could
   G#m7  Gm7    Em11/G
Chan_______ge      the world
