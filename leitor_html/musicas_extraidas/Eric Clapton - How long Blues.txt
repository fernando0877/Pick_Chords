How long Blues
Eric Clapton

    E              E7
How long, baby how long,
         A                  A7
Has that evening train been gone?
    E              B7              E     E
How long, how, how long, baby, how long?

            E                      E7
Went to the station, didn't see no train.
           A                       A7
Down in my heart, I have an aching pain.
    E              B7              E     E
How long, how, how long, baby, how long?

          E                 E7
I feel disgusted, I feel so bad
                   A                         A7
Thinking 'bout the good time that I once had had.
    E              B7              E     E
How long, how, how long, baby, how long?

                E                          E7
I could see the green grass growing on the hill;
                A                     A7
I ain't seen no greenback on a dollar bill.
    E              B7              E     E
How long, how, how long, baby, how long?

                E                 E7
You're gonna be sorry you feel so blue.
              A                                A7
When you want me, baby, I declare I want, want you.
    E              B7              E     E
How long, how, how long, baby, how long?
