 Dm C Bb (A C)


C#m                              G#7
  What will you do, when you get lonely
C#m      C       D     E
  No one waitin' by your side?
F#m            B7       E               A
   You've been running, hiding much too long
F#m             B7               E
You know, it's just your foolish pride


A7 Dm
  Layla, got me on my knees, Layla, 

  begging darling please, Layla, 

  darling won't you ease, my worried  mind?



C#m                 G#7
  Tried to give you consolation
C#m        C         D       E
  Your old man won't let you down
F#m      B7       E                A
  Like a fool  I fell in love with you
F#m         B7            E        A
  Turned my whole world upside down (Refrao)



C#m                    G#7
  Make the best of the situation
C#m         C       D    E
  Before  I finally go insane
F#m            B7         E            A
  Please don't say, we'll never find a way
F#m       B7               E
  Tell me all my love's in vain
