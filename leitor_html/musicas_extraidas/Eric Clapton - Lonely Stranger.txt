I was born with a ragin' thirst,
G#m  F#        B   B/A
A hunger to be free,
E        A/E     C#m         F#
But I've learned through the years

 Don't encourage me

D        A      E   (Intro)
 So just let me be

Some will say,  that I'm no good

E      A    C#m         F#
Take a look, then walk away
