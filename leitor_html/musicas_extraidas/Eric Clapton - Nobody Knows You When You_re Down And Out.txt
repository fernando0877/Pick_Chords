Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out
Eric Clapton
Key: C

 C               E7        A7
Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Dm           A7   Dm   Dm
Spent all my money, I didn't care
F         F#dim           C           A7
 Taking my friends, for a mighty good time
   D7                 G7
bought bootleg liquor, champagne and wine

C         E7      A7
 Then I began, to fall so low
Dm           A7          Dm   Dm
 lost my god friend, and no where to go 
F         F#dim        C       A7
  I get my hands, on a dollar again
   D7                      G7
I'll hang on to it till, the eagle grins

C    E7         A7
	Nobody knows you
Dm           A7        Dm 
	When your down and out
F          F#dim           C      A7
	In your pocket I haven't got a pennie
D7                     G7
  And as for friends I ain't got to many

C           E7                A7
 when I get back on my feet again
Dm           A7            Dm        Dm
  Everybody wants to be my long lost friend
F            F#dim         C       A7
  It's mighty strange with out any doubt
D7                  G7                  C7
   Nobody Knows you, when your down and out
