Old Love

Am7  Dm7                G4  G
        I can feel your body
Am7  Dm7                  G4  G
        When I`m lying in bed
Am7  Dm7                    G4  G
        There's too much confusion
Am7  Dm7             G4             G
        Going around through my head



    F                        E7
        And it makes me so angry
      Am                 Am7+        Am7   Am6
        To know that the flame still burns
    F                          E7
        ohh Why can't I get over?
            F                 E7
        And When will I ever learn



            Am7   Dm7  G4  G
        Old loove,
                  Am7  Dm7  G4  G
        leave me alone
            Am7   Dm7  G4  G
        Old looove,         
                   Am7  Dm7  G4  G
	     just go on home


Am7  Dm7                   G4  G
        I can see your face
Am7  Dm7                 G4  G
        But I know, in a real
Am7  Dm7                  G4  G
        this just an illuuusion
Am7  Dm7                           G4  G
        Caused by how I uuused to feeeeel
