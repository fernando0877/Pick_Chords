  It's late in the evening
C                       D
 She's wondering what clothes to wear
G                D/F#
 She puts on her make up
C                  D
 And brushes her long blonde hair
C               D     G      D/F#  Em
 And then she asks me,  Do I look alright
           C             D           G     D/F#  C  D
And I say yes, you look wonderful tonight (intro)

G           D/F#
 We go to a party
C              D
 And everyone turns to see
G               D/F#  C                 D
 This beautiful lady, That's walking around with me
C               D     G       D/F#  Em
 And then she asks me, Do you feel alright
           C           D          G     G7
And I say yes, I feel wonderful tonight  

        C           D
I feel wonderful, Because I see,
    G           D/F#    Em
the love light, in your eyes
          C             D
And i the wonder, of it all
            C    /B    /A   /G  D7
is that you just don't reeeeaaaalize
           G         D/F# C D
How much I love you (intro)

G                 D/F#    C                  D
 It's time to go home now, And I've got, an aching head
G                     D/F#  C                 D
 So I give her the car keys, She helps me, to bed

C           D        G     D/F#         Em
 And then I tell her, As I turn out the light
         C                 D           G    D/F# Em
I say my darling, you were wonderful tonight
      C                 D           G
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight (intro)
