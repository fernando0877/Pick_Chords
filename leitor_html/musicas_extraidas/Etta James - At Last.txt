At Last
Etta James

   F     Dm  Gm    C7         F          Dm 
At laaaaast     my loove, has come along,
Gm   C7              F    Dm 
  My lonely days are over
Gm    C7             F   Dm C#°    C7 
  And life is like a song..   ohh yeaaahh

   F   Dm Gm              C        F   Dm
At last      the skiiies above are blue
Gm   C7               F         Dm     
  My heart was wrapped in clover
Gm7         C7       F       Bb° F  F7
  The night I looked at you

          Gm   C7             F7      Dm
I found a dream,  that I can speak to,
             Em  F    Em          Am
A dream that Iiiiiiii can call my own,
          Dm      Gm         C
I found a thriiill  to press my cheek to,
C#°         Dm  Gm             C          C7
   A thrill Iiiiiii have never known, ohh yeahh

  F       Dm         
You smiled, you smile
Gm         C        F         Dm  
  oooh and then the spell was cast
Gm    C           F        Dm
  And here we are in heaven
Gm            C       F
  For you are mine at last
