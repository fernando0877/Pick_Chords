Hole Hearted
Extreme

E
Life´s ambition occupy my time
                       A
Priorities confuse the mind
E
Happiness one step behind
                              A
This inner peace, I´ve yet to find

A      A4
Rivers flow into the sea
    E7  
Yet even the sea, 

is not so full of me

   A        A4
If I´m, not blind, 

why can't  I see
      E7
That circle, can't fit where

a square should be

          D/F#
There's a hole in my heart
         G9                A
That can only be filled by you
         D/F#
And this hole in my heart
         G9
Can't be filled
                   A
with the things, I do

A    C/A
Hole hearted
     B/A
Hole hearted


This heart of stone is where I hide

These feet of clay kept warm inside

Day by day less satisfied

Not fade away before I die
