I don't know why (Clarence Henry)
Forrest Gump 

  G7+                                Am7
I don't know why I love you, but I do
  D7(9)                          G7+  D7
I don't know why I cry so, but I do
  G7+           G7          C7+       E7       A7
I only know I'm lonely, and that I, I want you only
  Am7              D7(9)           G7+
I don't know why I love you, but I do

  G7+                  /                Am7
I can't sleep nights because I, feel so restless
  D7(9)                            G7+      
I don't know what to do, I feel so helpless
    G7+                G7     C7+      E7        A7
And since you've been away, I cry both night and day
  C7+        E7     A7        D7    G7+
I don't know why, I love you, but I do

   C7+               Cm
My days have been so lonely
   G7+    B7           E7
My nights have been so blue
  A7                                D7
I don't know, how I stand it, but I do

     G7+                           Am7
Each night I sit alone and, tell myself
     D7                               G7+
That I will fall in love with someone else
  G7+               G6         E7              A7
I Guess I'm wastin' time, I've got to clear my mind
  C7+        A7    D7             G7+
I don't know why I love you but I do,
