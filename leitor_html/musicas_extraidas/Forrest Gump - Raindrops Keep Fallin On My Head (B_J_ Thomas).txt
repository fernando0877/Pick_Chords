Raindrops keep falling on my head
    F7                               Bb               Am
and just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed,
D7               Am   D7    Gm7
nothing seems to fit, Those raindrops are fallin' on my head they keep fallin'

C7        F                          Fmaj7
So I just did me some talkin' to the sun,
    F7                       Bb                 Am
and I said I didn't like the way he got things done
D7              Am   D7    Gm7
Sleepin' on the job, Those raindrops are fallin' 
on my head they keep fallin'
C7              F       Fmaj7
But there's one thing I know,
     Bb                C              Am
the blues they send to meet me, won't defeat me
                      D7              Gm7           Bb  C  Bb  C
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

  F                          Fmaj7
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head,
    F7                             Bb               Am
but that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red,
D7              Am   D7    Gm7
Cryin's not for me, cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
C7          F     C7
because I'm free, nothings worryin in me

F  Fmaj7  Bb  C  Am
                      D7              Gm7         Bb  C  Bb  C
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me
