D Em A

                    D                  Em
Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today
          D                            Em          A
I want to be a part of it - New York, New York
                 D                    Em
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray
                   D                            D7
Right through the very heart of it - New York, New York

        G               Gm                  D
I want to wake up in a city, that doesn't sleep
              F#m            B7             Em       A
And find I'm king of the hill - top of the heap


                   D                  Em
These little town blues, are melting away
                  D                              D7
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it - in old New York
        G         Gm                D       B7
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
            Em   F#m G     A    D
It's up to you - New York, New York
