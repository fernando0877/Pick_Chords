Dm7           F/G  C7+               F7+  
Used to be so easy to give my heart away
Bm7(b5)                      E   Am   B(4)         Am/C     Am
But I've found that the hard way is a price you have to pay

I've found that the hard way, it's a road that leads to pain

I've found that love was more than just a game

To play and to win but to lose just the same

  Though the days come and go, there's one thing I know
       F9            E7#9      Am
  I've still got the blues for you
