I Cant Dance
Genesis

capo1
Am
  Hot sun, beating down
                      G        D
Burning my feet, just walking around
Am
 Hot sun making me sweat
                             G      D
Gators getting close, hasn't got me yet

Am
 I cant dance, I cant talk
                           G      D
Only thing about me is the WAY I walk
Am
 I cant dance, I cant sing
                       G            A
I'm just standing here selling (everything)

Blue jeans sitting on the beach,
Her dogs talking to me, but shes out of reach
Shes got a body, under that shirt,
But all she wants to do, is rub my face in the dirt
(REFRÃO)

       C                         Bm
Oh and checking everything is in place,
          A
You never know whos looking on

Young punk spilling beer on my shoes
Fat guys talking to me trying to STEAL my blues
Thick smoke, see her smiling through
I never thought so much could happen just SHOOting pool.
(REFRÃO)
       C                         B
Oh and checking everything is in place
          Am
You never know whos looking on
  C             Bb             G
A perfect body, with a perfect face
