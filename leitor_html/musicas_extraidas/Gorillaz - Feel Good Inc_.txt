D#m                A#m
City's breaking down on a camel's back
G#m                   A#m
They just have to go cos they don't know wack

So all you fill the streets it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county, 'cos you're bad and free

You've got a new horizon It's ephemeral style.
A melancholy town where we never smile.

And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
My dreams, they've got to kiss, because I don't get sleep, no..

D#m                A#m
Windmill, Windmill for the land.
G#m                   A#m
Turn forever hand in hand
D#m                A#m
Take it all in on your stride
G#m                   A#m
It is ticking, falling down

D#m                A#m
Love forever, love has freely
G#m                   A#m
Turned forever you and me
D#m                A#m
Windmill, windmill for the land
G#m           A#m
Is everybody in?
