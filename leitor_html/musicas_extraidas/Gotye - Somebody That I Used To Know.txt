Gotye

Dm           C               Dm     C      Dm    C ( Dm  C )
   Now and then I think of when, we were together
Dm                C                Dm   C         Dm  C  Dm  C
   Like when you said, you felt so happy, You could die
Dm        C                  Dm        C
   Told myself that you were right for me
Dm              C              Dm     C
   But felt so lonely in your company
Dm               C                Dm      C      Dm    C  Dm  C
   But that was love and it's an ache, I still remember

 Dm            C           Dm      C       Dm     C
You can get addicted to a, certain kind of sadness
Dm            C            Dm C          Dm  C  Dm  C
   Like resignation to the end Always the end
Dm             C                   Dm       C
   So when we found that we could not make sense
 Dm       C                   Dm        C
Well you said that we would still be friends
 Dm         C               Dm   C         Dm   C  Dm  C
But I'll admit that I was, glad that it was over

Dm          C              Bb5(9) C
   But you didn't, have to cut me  off
Dm           C             Bb5(9)          C          Dm
   Make out like it, never happened, And that we were nothing

    C             Bb5(9)    C
And I don't even need your love
          Dm               C              Bb5(9)   C
But you treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough

Dm          C               Bb5(9)  C
   No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Dm              C                  Bb5(9)
   Have your friends collect your records
           C          Dm
And then change your number
    C                 Bb5(9)     C
I guess that I don't need that though
 Dm                  C          Bb5(9)    C
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

   Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me Over
 Dm           C             Dm
But had me believing it was always something
  C       Dm  C  Dm  C
That I'd done
C
And I don't wanna live that way

Reading into every word you say

You said that you could let it go

And I wouldn't catch you hung up on
