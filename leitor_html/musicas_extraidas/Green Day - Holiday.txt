Green Day

F            Db           Ab      Eb 
   Hear the sound of the falling rain
F          Db          Ab   C       F 
   Coming down like an Armageddon flame (hey)
      Db       Ab        Eb      C 
The shame, the ones who died without a name

F            Db          Ab      Eb 
   Hear the dogs howling out of key
F        Db           Ab        C   F 
   To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (hey)
      Db        Ab      Eb       C 
And bleed, the company lost the war today


F             Db               Ab             Eb 
   I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
F               Db             Ab          C 
   This is the dawning of the rest of our lives, On Holiday

F             Db          Ab      Eb 
   Hear the drum pounding out of time
F            Db   Ab       C          F 
   Another protestor has crossed the line (hey)
    Db        Ab     Eb     C 
To find, the money's on the other side

F         Db   Ab      Eb 
   Can I get another Amen? (Amen)
F              Db 
   There's a flag wrapped
  Ab       C       F 
Around a score of men (hey)
   Db      Ab     Eb       C 
A gag, A plastic bag on a monument


F             Db               Ab             Eb 
   I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
F               Db             Ab          C 
   This is the dawning of the rest of our lives

Db   Ab   C 

The representative from California has the floor
Zieg Heil to the president gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
                     Eb    C   F 
Is not a way that's meant for me
C 
   Just cause, Just cause, because we're outlaws

F             Db               Ab             Eb 
   I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
F               Db             Ab          C 
   This is the dawning of the rest of our lives

F             Db               Ab             Eb 
   I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
F               Db             Ab          C 
   This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
                          F   Db   Ab   Eb 
This is our lives on Holiday
