Green Day



 A#   G#  
I sit around and watch the tube but nothing's on
I change the channel's for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In the house with unlocked doors and I'm fucking lazy

D#  A#           G#       D#       A# 
       Bite my lip and close my eyes
        G#       D# 
Take me away to paradise
A#               G#        D#     A#                     G#  D# 
    I'm so damn bored I'm going blind and I smell like shit

Peel me off this Velcrow seat
And get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I've locked the doors to my own cell and I've lost the key

D#  A#           G#       D#       A# 
       Bite my lip and close my eyes

        G#       D# 
Take me away to paradise
A#               G#        D#     A#                     G# 
    I'm so damn bored I'm going blind and I smell like shit

D#           C# 
I've got no motivation
  D#         C# 
Where is my motivation?
 D#          C# 
No time for motivation
  D#       C#     A#    G#   D#   A#   G#   D#   A#   G#   D# 
Smoking my inspi-ration

( A#   G#  )

I sit around and watch the phone
But no ones calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun you're fucking lonely

D#  A#           G#       D#       A# 
       Bite my lip and close my eyes
        G#       D# 
Take me away to paradise
A#              G#         D#     A# 
    I'm so damn bored I'm going blind
        G#         D# 
And lonliness has to subside
A#           G#       D#       A# 
    Bite my lip and close my eyes
                G#       D# 
Slowly slipping away to paradise
A#              G#     D#        A#                    G#  D# 
    Some say "Quit, or I'll go blind" but it's just a myth
