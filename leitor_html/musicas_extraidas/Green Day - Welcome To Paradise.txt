Dear Mother, Can you hear me whining?
E           D                 G                B 
It's been 3 whole weeks since I have left your home
E              D                   E 
This sudden fear has left me trembling
E              D              G             B 
Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
        G            B 
And I'm feeling so alone

E             G                    A            C 
Pay attention to the cracked streets, and broken homes
E                  G              B 
Some call it slums, some call it nice
E              G                   A            C 
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my
E   B 
Home    welcome to Paradise


E              D              E 
A gunshot rings out at the station
E           D                 G                B 
Another urchin snaps, and left dead on his own
E              D                   E 
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
E              D              G             B 
For some strange reason it's now feeling like my home
         G           B 
And I'm never gonna go

E             G                    A            C 
Pay attention to the cracked streets, and broken homes
E                  G              B 
Some call it slums, some call it nice
E              G                   A            C 
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my

Dear Mother, Can you hear me laughing?
E           D                 G                B 
It's been six whole months since I have left your home
E              D                   E 
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
