When I come around 
Green Day

G    D                Em     C
   I heard you crying loud
G          D         Em     C
  all the way across town
             G                  D
You've been searching for that someone
         Em              C
and it's me out on the prowl
    G            D         Em           C
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
 
G       D                Em    C
  Well, don't get lonely now
G     D                Em     C
  And dry your whining eyes
         G               D
I'm just roaming for the moment
         Em                     C
Sleazin' my back yard so don't get
G               D                   Em        C
so uptight you been thinking about ditching me
 
 
Am                        C
    No time to search the world around
Am                               C
    Cause you know where I'll be found
                 G
    When I come around
 
 
G    D             Em     C
  I heard it all before
G     D                   Em     C
  So don't knock down my door
       G           D         Em            C
I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser
    G               D              Em          C
to try and slag me down because I know you're right
G    D              Em    C
  So go do what you like
G       D             Em   C
  Make sure you do it wise
         G                  D
You may find out that your self doubt
        Em             C
means nothing was ever there
     G                D
You can't go forcing something
         Em       C
if it's just not right
