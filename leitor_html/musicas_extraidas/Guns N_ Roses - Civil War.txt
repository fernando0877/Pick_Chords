Em  G  D/F#
"What we've got here
Is failure to communicate
Some men you just can't reach
So you get what we had here last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
I don't like it any more than you men"

 Em
Look at your young men fighting
 G
Look at your women crying
 Em
Look at your young men dying
  G                     D/F#
The way they've always done before

Em
Look at the hate we're breeding
 G
Look at the fear we're feeding
 Em
Look at the lives we're leading
     G                D/F#       A
The way we've always done before

              Em
My hands are tied
     G
The billions shift from side to side
         Em
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
         G                   D/F#
For the love of god and our human rights

    Em
And all these things are swept aside
     G
By bloody hands time can't deny
         Em
And are washed away by your genocide
     G                 D/F#              A5
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

                 G
Did you wear a black armband
            Bm
When they shot the man

Who said
Em
   Peace could last forever
           G
And in my first memories
          Bm
They shot    Kennedy
Em                  C          D
I went numb when I learned to see

      G              Bm
So I never fell for Vietnam
            Em
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all
          G
That you can't trust freedom
           Bm
When it's not in your hands
     Em
When everybody's fighting
              C5    D5
For their promised land

G              B5              E5
  And I don't need your civil war
G               B5                       E5  ( C5  D5 
  It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
)

G               B5
  You're power hungry sellin' soldiers
     E5
In a    human grocery store, ain't that fresh?
G          B5              E5  ( C5  D5 )
  I don't need your civil war

 Em
Look at the shoes you're filling
 G
Look at the blood we're spilling
 Em
Look at the world we're killing
     G                D/F#
The way we've always done before

 Em
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
 G
Look at the leaders we've followed
 Em
Look at the lies we've swallowed
    G              D/F#
And I don't wanna hear no more

              Em
My hands are tied
    G
For all I've seen has changed my mind
               Em
But still the wars go on as the years go by
         G              D/F#
With no love of god or human rights

      Em
Cause all these dreams are swept aside
     G
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
     Em
Who carry the cross of homicide
     G                  D/F#              Em
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

"We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and government officials
For example to create a vacuum then we fill that 
vacuum
As popular war advances, peace is closer"

G          B5              E5
  I don't need your civil war
G               B5                       E5  ( C5  D5 
  It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
)

G               B5
  You're power hungry sellin' soldiers
     E5
In a    human grocery store, ain't that fresh?
G              B5              E5  ( C5  D5 )
  And I don't need your civil war

G          B5              E5
  I don't need your civil war
G          B5              E5 ( C5  D5 )
  I don't need your civil war
G               B5
  You're power hungry sellin' soldiers
     E5
In a    human grocery store, ain't that fresh?
G          B5              E5 ( C5  D5 )
  I don't need your civil war

I don't need one more war
I don't need one more war

What's so civil about war, anyway?
