  When you were young and your heart was an open book
G             Bm7              C6
  You used to say live and let live
              D7                D7b9             G
(You know you did, you know you did you know you did)
G             Bm7           C6                A
  But if this ever changing world in which we live in
          D                 Bb/D
Makes you give in and cry
