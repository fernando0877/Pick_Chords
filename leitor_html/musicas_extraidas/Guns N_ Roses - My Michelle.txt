Your daddy works in porno
F#                      A E F#
Now that mommy's not around
C#                    C B
She used to love her heroin
C#                D C#
But now she's underground
C#                    C B
So you stay out late at night
F#                      A E F#
And you do your coke for free
C#                    C B
Drivin' your friends crazy
F#                      A E F#
With your life's insanity

Well, well, well you just can't tell
D     C#    B    A
Well, well, well my Michelle

C#                    C B
Sowin' all your wild oats
F#               A E F#
In another's luxuries
C#                 C B
Yesterday was Tuesday
C#                     D C#
Maybe Thursday you can sleep
C#                       C B
But school starts much too early
F#                      A E F#
And this hotel wasn't free
C#                        C B
So party till your connection calls
F#                    A E F#
Honey I'll return the key

E           D A
Everyone needs love
B                  G E
You know that it's true
E                G   B
Someday you'll find someone
B
That'll fall in love with you
E           D A
But oh the time it takes
B                  G E
When you're all alone
E                G   B
Someday you'll find someone
B
That you can call your own

But till then ya better...

C#               C B
Now you're clean
F#               A E F#
And so discreet
C#               C B
I won't say a word
F#                          A E F#
But most of all this song is true
C#                   C B
Case you haven't heard
F#                          A E F#
So c'mon and stop your cryin'
C#                         C B
'Cause we both know money burns
F#                    A E F#
Honey don't stop tryin;
F#                          A E F#
