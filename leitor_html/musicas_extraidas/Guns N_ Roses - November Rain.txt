November Rain
Guns N' Roses

capo 4, piano E, 1a inersao
C                     Am                       G     /
When I look into your eyes,I can see a love restrained
C     C              Am                                 G  /
  But darlin' when I hold you,Don't you know I feel the same, uuh iêê

Am   /               D                                   G
 And Nothing lasts forever, And we both, know hearts can change
Am        /              D                            G
 And it's hard to hold a candle, In the cold November rain

C      /                         Am
 We've been through this, such a long long time
     /                  G
Just trying to kill the pain.. uuuh iee

    C                      C7+
But love is always coming, love is always going
Am               /            /           G             /
no one's, really sure, who's letting go today (Walking away)
   C                 /       C
If’we could take the time,To lay it, on the line
        Am                 /                      G         /
I could rest my head, Just knowing, that you were mine (All mine)

Am   /              D                            G
  So if you want to love me,Then darling don't refrain
Am      /             D                             G   
   I'll just, end up, walking, In the cold November rain

        C                       D
 Do you need some time, on your own
        C                    D
 Do you need some time, all alone, uhhhh
           C                         D
 Everybody needs some time, On their own, Uhhh
                     C                    D
 Don't you know, you need some time, all alone

Bm  /            C                 G
    I know, it's hard, to keep, an open heart
Bm      /     C            /       Am
   When even friends, seem out, to harm you
Bm        C                  G
   But if you, could heal, a broken heart
Bm          C               D                  C Am G G (2x) Am D/F# G G
   Wouldn't time, be out to charm you.. ohhh (SOLO)

            C                    D
Sometimes I need, some time, on my Own
 Sometimes I need some time, all alone, uhhh
 Everybody needs some time, on their own, uhhhh
 Don't you know you need some time, all alone (Solo2)

C /                  Am         /               G    /
  when your fears subside, and shadows still remain, oooh ieee
C  /                  Am                    /               G      /
 I know that you, can love me, When there's no, one left to blame, oohh ieeee
C     /               Am            /                G   /
   So never mind, the darkness, We still can find a way
Am       /              D            /           G
  Cause nothin' lasts forever, Even cold November rain
G   D/F#   Em   D/F#   C   C   D (2x)
