  A           C
   Guess I needed
  G                  F  G
   Sometime to get away
  A                C
   I needed some peace of mind
  G                             F G
   Some piece of mind that'll stay
  A        C
   So I thumbed it
  G                   F  G
   Down to sixth and L.A.
  A          C
   Maybe a Greyhound
  G             F  G
   Could be my way
  A              C
   Police and niggers, that's right
  G               F  G
   Get out of my way
  A               C
   Don't need to buy

   None of your gold chains today
  A                    C
   I don't need to bracelets
  G                        F   G
   Clamped in front on my back
  A                C
   Just need my ticket till then
  G                        F   G

  G                               F    G
   And think they'll do as they please
