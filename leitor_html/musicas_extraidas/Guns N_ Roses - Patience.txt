C  G  C  Em  C  G  D
C
  Shed a tear cause I'm missing you
G
  I'm still alright to smile
A7                               D
   Girl I think about you every day now

C
  Was a time when I wasn't sure
        G
But you   set my mind at easy
A7                                 D
   There is no doubt you're in my heart now

C               G
  Said, woman, take it slow
           C               Em
And it'll work itself out fine
C               G             D
All we need is just a little patience
C               G
  Said, sugar, make it slow
           C             Em
And we'll come together fine
C               G             D
All we need is just a little patience, Patience

C
  I sit here on the stairs
          G
Cause I'd   rather be alone
   A7                               D
If I can't have you right now I'll wait dear

C
  Sometimes I get so tense
       G
But I can't speed up the time
     A7
But you know love
                              D
There's one more thing to consider

C             G
  Said woman take it slow
      C                  Em
And things will be just fine
 C                G             D
You and I'll just use a little patience
C             G
  Said sugar take the time
           C                   Em
Cause the lights are shining bright
 C            G                    D
You and I've got what it takes to make it
We won't fake it, Oh, I'll never break it
Cause I can't take it

C  G  C  Em  C  G  D

D                          D/F#
  I've been walking the streets tonight
G
  Just trying to get it right
D                           D/F#
  It's hard to see with so many around
      G
You know, I don't like, being stuck in the crowd
           D                      D/F#
And the streets, don't change but baby the names
G
  I ain't got time for the game
         D
Cause I need you
 D/F#       G
Yeah but I need you

Oh, I need you
       G
Oh, I need you
          D       D/F#  G  D
Oh, this time

Some more patience, yeah
Need some patience
Could use some patience
Gotta have some patience
All it takes is patience
Just a little patience
Is all you need
