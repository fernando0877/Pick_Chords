Rocket Queen
Guns N' Roses

  F#
   If I say I don't need anyone
        A5
   I can say these things to you
         E
   'Cause I can turn on anyone
         F#
   Just like I've turned on you
             B5
   I've got a tongue like a razor
   A sweet switchblade knife
       C#
   And I can do you favors
             E5
   But then you'll do whatever I like

          F#m                       E5
   Here I am   And you're a Rocket Queen
            A5
   I might be a little young
        B5        E5     F#m
   But, honey, I ain't naive
         F#m                       E5
   Here I am   And you're a Rocket Queen
            A5
   I might be too much
        B5                      F#5
   But, honey, you're a bit obscene

  F#5
   I've seen everything imaginable
    A5
   Pass before these eyes
           E5
   I've had everything that's tangible
    F#5
   Honey, you'd be surprised
           B5
   I'm a sexual innuendo
   In this burned out paradise
           C#5
   If you turn me on to anything
               E5
   You better turn me on tonight

Refrao:

  E             C#m
   I see you standing
  E                 B
   Standing on your own
  E                C#m
   It's such a lonely place for you
  E             B
   For you to be
  E                 C#m
   If you need a shoulder
  E                     B
   Or if you need a friend
  E                  C#m
   I'll be there standing
      E               B
   Until the bitter end
  E5                   C#5
   No one needs the sorrow
  E5                   B5
   No one needs the pain
  E5            C#5
   I hate to see you
                E5
   Walking out there
                B5
   Out in the rain
  E5              C#5
   So don't chastise me
  E5                     B5
   Or think I, I mean you harm
  E5                C#5
   Of those that take you
                    E5
   Leave you strung out
            B5          (E B5 C#5)4x
   Much too far, baby, yeah

  E5               C#5
   Don't ever leave me
  E5                       B5
   Say you'll always be there
  E5              C#5
   All I ever wanted
             A5
   Was for you
       G#5         E5
   To know that I care
