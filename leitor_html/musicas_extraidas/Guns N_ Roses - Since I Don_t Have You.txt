Since I Don't Have You
Guns N' Roses

G           C         D
I don't have plans and schemes
    G         C          D
And I don't have hopes and dreams
G          C
I don't have anything
Am            D
Since I don't have you

    G          C     D
And I don't have fond desires
    G          C      D
and I don't have happy hours
G          C
I don't have anything
Am                 G
Since I don't have you

Am                G
Happiness, and I guess
Am            G
I never will again
Am
When you walked out on me
G
In walked ol' misery

Am                  D
And she's been here since then.

G Cm Am D

G         Cm         D
I don't have love to share
G         Cm         D
And I don't have one who cares
G         Cm
I don't have anything
Am               D
Since I don't have you
