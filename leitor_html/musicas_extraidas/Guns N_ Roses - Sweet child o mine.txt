C
She's got a smile that it seems to me
  Bb
Reminds me of childhood memories
      F                                         C
Where everything, Was as fresh as a bright blue sky

C
Now and then when I see her face
    Bb
She takes me away to that special place
         F
And if I stared too long
                              C
I'd probably break down and cry

G               Bb             C
Whoa Oh, Sweet child o' mine   
G               Bb             C   C Bb F C
Whoa, Oh, Oh, Oh Sweet love o' mine

C
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
   Bb
As if they thought of rain
  F
I hate to look into those eyes
    C
And see an ounce of pain

    C
Her hair reminds, me of a warm safe place
      Bb
Where as a child I'd hide
    F
And pray for the thunder
             C
and rain To quietly pass me by

G        Bb             C
Whoa Oh, oh, Sweet child o' mine
G              Bb               C   C Bb F C
Whoa, Oh, Oh, Oh Sweet love o' mine

G               Bb             C
