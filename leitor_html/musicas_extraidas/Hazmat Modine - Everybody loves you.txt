Everybody loves you
Hazmat Modine

Bm   A    Bm  /  / /
Everybody loves you, Nobody don't
Everybody wants some but, Nobody wants

When I'm in the mood for, When I'm on the road
When I'm in the mood for, When I'm on the road
For your love


Everybody's watching, Don't want to judge
Everybody's listening, But they dont wanna touch

Everyone's forming, No one suspects
Everybody's calling you, But, no one connects
