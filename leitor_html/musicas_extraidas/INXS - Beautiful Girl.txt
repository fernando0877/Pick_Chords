  Nicky's on the corner
B                 E
  With a black coat on
B                E
  Running from a bad home
B                 E
  With some cat inside
B                   E
  Now where did you find her
B                E
  Among the neon lights
B                  E 
  That haunt the streets outside (she says)
B           E
  Stay with me

   She wanna go home

B                 E
  From doorway to doorway
B                   E
  Street corner to corner
          B        E
With the neon ghosts in the city
   E
And she says

           B  E
Stay with me (2x)

Stay with me

B            E  B
She's so scared
         E
So very frightened
B            E        B
Anything could happen
              E
Right here tonight
