Never Tear us Apart
INXS


ternario
Am  F  Dm  F

      Am                F
Don't ask me, what you know is true
               Dm 
Don't have to tell you, 
  F
I love your, precious heart


C  F        C      F           C      
I,  I was standing,   you were there
F               C    
   Two worlds collided
F                 G
   and they could never, tear us apart
A  C  D  Am


Am                   F
We could live, For a thousand years
          Dm 
But if I hurt you    
         F
I'd make wine from your tears

   Am               F
I told you, That we could fly
         Dm            
'Cause we all have wings,
F
some of us, don't know why
