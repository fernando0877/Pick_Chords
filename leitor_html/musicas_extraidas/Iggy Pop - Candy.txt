Beautiful beautiful, girl from the north

You burned my heart, with a flickering torch
        Bm             C 
I had a dream, that no one else could see
            Am        D  C 
You gave me love for free

Life is crazy, Candy baby

 G  G C  E  (2x)
Yeah, well it hurt me, real bad when you left
I'm glad you got out but I miss you

G                      C         Em 
I've had a hole, in my heart for so long
G                            C           D 
I've learned to fake it, and just smile along
            Bm            C 
Down on the street, those men, are all the same
         Am        D    C      D     C 
I need a love, not games,  not gaaaaaames
