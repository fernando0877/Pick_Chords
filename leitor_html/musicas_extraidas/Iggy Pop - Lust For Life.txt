Hey man, where'd ya get that lotion?
I've been hurting since I've, bought the gimmick
About something called love

I have a lust for life
'Cause of a lust for life

With my torture film, Drive a GTO, Wear a uniform
All on a government loan

I'm through with sleeping on the sidewalk
No more beating my brains

With liqor and drugs
