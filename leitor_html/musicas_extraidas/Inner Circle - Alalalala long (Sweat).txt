Alalalala long (Sweat)
Inner Circle

C           Am              Dm     G
  Alalalala long, Alalalala long...

C          Am                 Dm        G
  Standing across the room, I saw you smile
C          Am                 Dm             G
  I said I want to talk to you, for a little while
C              Am               Dm             G
  But before I make my move, my emotions start running wild

-------
C                Am        Dm        G
  My tongue gets tied, and that's no lie
                    C    Am      Dm
I'm looking in your eeeeeeeeeyes,
    G                        C
I'm looking in you big brown eyes
     Am        Dm            G
Ooh yeah, I've got to say to you

C                 Am
  Girl, I want to make you sweat,
Dm                      G
  sweat till you can't, sweat no more
C            Am             Dm                 G
  And if you cryyy out, I'm gonna push it some mooore
G                       C
  Push it, push it some more

C           Am              Dm     G
  Alalalala long, Alalalala long...
----------

C           Am                Dm          G
  So I said to myself, If she loves me or not?
C                     Am         Dm             G
  But the dreads done know, that love is his to get
C               Am                 Dm             G
  With a little bit of this, and a little bit of that
  The lyrics goes on the attack,
