Fear of the dark 
Iron Maiden

Dm       Bb            C
  I am a man who walks alone,
             Bb      C      Dm
and when I'm walking a dark road
             Bb                   C         Bb      C      Dm
at night or strolling through the park
Dm       Bb              C
When the lights begin to change,
             Bb     C      Dm
I sometimes feel a little strange
         Bb                C
a little anxious when it's dark
 
 
 
 
            Bb    C                Dm      C
Fear of the dark,      Fear of the dark,
         Bb                 F           C      Dm
I have a constant fear that something's always near
            Bb    C                Dm     C
Fear of the dark,      Fear of the dark,
         Bb          F         C      Dm
I have a phobia that someone's always there
 
 
Dm                   Bb              C
  Have you run your fingers down the wall
              Bb          C        Dm
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
             Bb                C       Bb      C      Dm
When you're searching for the light
          Dm           Bb               C
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
        Bb        C   Dm
At the corner of the room
                    Bb                   C
You've sensed that something's watching you
 
 
 
 
            Bb    C                Dm      C
Fear of the dark,      Fear of the dark,
         Bb                 F           C      Dm
I have a constant fear that something's always near
            Bb    C                Dm     C
Fear of the dark,      Fear of the dark,
         Bb          F         C      Dm
I have a phobia that someone's always there
 
 

 
Dm               Bb            C
  Have you ever been alone at night
             Bb        C      Dm
Thought you heard footsteps behind
             Bb                 C       Bb      C      Dm
And turned around and no one's there?
            Dm         Bb   C
And as you quicken up your pace
             Bb      C     Dm
You find it hard to look again
                Bb                    C
Because you're sure there's someone there
 
 
 
 
            Bb    C                Dm      C
Fear of the dark,      Fear of the dark,
         Bb                 F           C      Dm
I have a constant fear that something's always near
            Bb    C                Dm     C
Fear of the dark,      Fear of the dark,
         Bb          F         C      Dm
I have a phobia that someone's always there
 
 
Verse 4:
 
Dm                 Bb                C
  Watching horror films the night before
             Bb      C   Dm
Debating witches and folklore
             Bb               C       Bb      C      Dm
The unknown troubles on your mind
            Dm       Bb      C
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
                Bb      C    Dm
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
             Bb           C
On dancing shadows from behind
