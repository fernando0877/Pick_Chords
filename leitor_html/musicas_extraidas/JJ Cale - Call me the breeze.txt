They call me the breeze, I keep blowing down the road

I ain't got me nobody, I ain t carrying me no load  

         E   
Ain't no change in the weather, ain't no change in me  
               A                                         E  
There ain't no change in the weather, ain't no change in me  
        B7                 A7                      E  
I ain't hiding from nobody, nobody's hiding from me
