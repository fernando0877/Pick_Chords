Sitting, Waiting, Wishing
Jack Johnson

Am  Am7  G  G7  F  F7  C  C7
     Am               Am7
Well I was, sitting, waiting, wishing
 G               G7
You believed in superstitions
  F               F7      C    C7
Then maybe you'd see the signs

     Am                   Am7
But lord knows that, this world is cruel
      G                      G7
And I ain't the lord, no I'm just a fool
          F                      F7         C      C7
Learning loving some, body don't make, them love you

       E   E7       E        E7         Am  Am7  Am  Am7
Must I alllways, be waiting, waiting on you?
       E   E7       E        E7          Am  Am7  Am  Am7
Must I alllways be playing, playing your fool?

   Am                 Am7
I sang your songs, I danced your dance
   G                G7
I gave your friends, all a chance
 F                    F7                  C         C7
Putting up with them, wasn't worth, never having you

    Am                         Am7
Oh maybe you've been, through this before
          G                 G7
But it's my first time, so please ignore
       F               F7                C      C7
These next few lines, cause they're directed at you

        E  E7      E        E7         Am  Am7  Am  Am7
I can't allways, be waiting, waiting on you?
        E  E7       E        E7          Am  Am7  Am  Am7
I can't always, be playing, playing your fool

C                      E                     F
  I keep playing your part, But it's not my scene
                    G               F          C
Want this plot to twist, I've had enough mystery
                 E                               F
Keep building it up, But then you're shooting me down
                 G                  Am  Am7
But I'm already down, Just wait a minute

G       G7          F  F7  C       C7       Am  Am7
  Just sitting, waiting...  ..Just wait a minute
G      G7          F   F7  C  C7
  Just sitting, waiting

     Am           Am7
Well if I was, in your position
     G               G7
I'd put down all, my amuntintion
     F                 F7          C   C7
I'd wonder why it had taken me so long

         Am              Am7
But the Lord knows that, I'm not you
    G                    G7
And if I was, I wouldn't be so cruel
       F                     F7         C   C7
Cause waitin' on love ain't so easy to do

        E E7      E        E7         Am  Am7  Am  Am7
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
       E  E7       E        E7          Am  Am7  Am  Am7
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?
           E  E7      E        E7         Am  Am7  Am  Am7
No I can't always be waiting, waiting on you?
        E  E7       E        E7          Am  Am7
I can't always be playing, playing your fool
 E   E7      Am
