Ball and Chain
Janis Joplin

Gm                    Cm
Sitting down by my window,
     Gm
Oh, looking at the rain.
Cm
S-sitting down by my window now now,

All around I felt it,
                     Gm
All I could see was the rain.
Dm
Something grabbed a hold of me, honey,
        Cm       Bb   Am          Gm
Felt to me honey like, lord, a ball and chain.
      Cm
Yeah! hey! you know what I mean,
Dm
But its way too heavy for you,

You cant hold it tomorrow.

Gm                            Cm
Say, whoa, whoa, honey, it cant be

Just because I got to want your love
             Gm
Please please please please, whoa please, please.

Whoa, honey it cant be

Just because I got to need you daddy.
Gm
Please dont you let me down, no, please, lord!
Dm                                 Cm

I wanted to hold you, yeah, till the day I die,
Cm
Till the day, till the day,
Dm
Yeah! hey! hey! all right!

Gm                              Cm
Say, whoa, whoa, honey this cant be

Not anything I ever wanted from you daddy
