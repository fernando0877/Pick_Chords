    A              F#m       D        E7
Oh Lord, won't you buy me, a Mercedes-Benz?
     C#m              F#m         B7         E7
My friends all, drive Porsches, I must make amends
       D            B7           D     E7         A
Worked hard, all my lifetime, no help, from my friends
   F#7             B7        D  E7    A
So Lord, won't you buy me, a Mercedes-Benz?

    A              F#m       D     E7
Oh Lord, won't you buy me, a color tv?
C#m         F#m         B7              E7
Dialing for Dollars' is trying, to find me
  D          B7           E7         A
I wait for delivery, each day, until three
   F#7             B7        D  E7    A
So Lord, won't you buy me, a cooolor tv?

    A              F#m       D             E7
Oh Lord, won't you buy me, a night, on the town?
    C#m              F#m   B7                  E7
I'm counting, on you Lord, please don't let me down
D               B7           D    E7       A
Prove, that you love me, and buy, the next round
   F#7             B7        D     E7     A
Oh Lord, won't you buy me, a night on the town?
