Move Over
Janis Joplin

Dm
You say that it's over baby, Lord
You say that it's over now
But still you hang around me, come on
Won't you move over

You know that I need a man, honey Lord
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can

Please don't you do it to me babe, no (riff)
Please don't you do it to me baby (riff)
Either take this love, I offer
Or just let me be

I ain't quite a ready for walking, (riff)
I ain't quite a ready for walking (riff)
And what you gonna do, with your life
Life all just dangling?

Em
  Oh Make up your mind (honey)
G7
  You're playing with me, (hey hey hey)
Em
  Make up your mind, (darling)
G7
  You're playing with me, come on now
A7
  Now either be, my loving man (I said-a)
C               C   C  B   Bb Bb A7  
  let me honey, let me be

Dm
You say that it's over, baby, no
You say that it's over now
But still you hang around me, come on
Won't you move over

You know that I need a man, honey, I told you so
You know that I need a man
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can

Hey! Please don't you do it to me, babe, no
Please don't you do it to me baby
Either take this love I offer
Honey let me be

I said won't you, won't you let me be
Honey, you're teasing me
Yeah, you're playing with my heart, dear
I believe you're toying, with my affections, honey
I can't take it no more baby
And furthermore, I don't intend to
I'm just tired of hanging from the end of a string, honey
You expect me to fight like a goddamned mule
Wah, wah, wah, wah, honey
