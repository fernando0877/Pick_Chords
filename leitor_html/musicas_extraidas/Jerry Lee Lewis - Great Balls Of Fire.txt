Great Balls Of Fire
Jerry Lee Lewis

C
  You shake my nerves, and you rattle my brain
F7
   Too much love,  drives a man insane
G7                   F7
   You broke my will,   but what a thrill
 C
Coodness gracious, great balls of fire

C
I laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny
F7
   You came along, and moved me, honey
G7                      F7
   I've changed my mind,   this love is fine
C
  Coodness gracious, great balls of fire

solo.... weeeellll

F7                C
   Kiss me, baby, uhmm, feels good
F7                 G7
   Hold me, baby, well

I want to love you, like a lover should

You're fine, So kind

I got to tell this world 
that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

C
  I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
F7
   I'm real nervous, but it sure is fun
G7                      F7
   Come on, baby, you drive me crazy
 C
Coodness gracious, great balls of fire
