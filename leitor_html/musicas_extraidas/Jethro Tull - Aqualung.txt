Capo: 3

Gm             C#   C    C#
Sitting on  a  park bench
Eb                        F          /Eb F Eb F/ F#  C#/
Eyeing little girls, with bad intent

Eb Eb C#/ F# F# E  B D)

Snot is running down his nose
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes
hey, Aqualung  

Drying in the cold sun 
Watching as the frilly panties run 
hey Aqualung 

Feeling like a dead duck
Spitting out pieces of his broken luck. 
ooh Aqualung 

Gm            F
Sun streaking cold,
                      C
an old man wondering lonely
Cm              Gm          F
Taking time the only way he knows

Leg hurting bad, 
as he bends to pick a dog end
He goes down to the bog 
and warms his feet

Feeling alone, the armies up the road
Salvation al-a-mode and a cup of tea

Aqualung my friend, 
don't you start away uneasy
You poor old sod you see it's only me

Gm             F
Do you still remember,
Decembers foggy freeze?
When the ice that clings on to your beard, 
was screaming agony

Gm                   F
And you snatch your rattling last breathes
                     C
with deep-sea-diver-sounds
Cm                   Gm
And the flowers bloomed
             F
like madness in the spring

Sun streaking cold, 
an old man wondering lonely
Taking time the only way he knows

Leg hurting bad, 
as he bends to pick a dog end
He goes down to the bog and warms his feet

Feeling alone, the armies up the road
Salvation al-a-mode and a cup of tea

Aqualung my friend, 
don't you start away uneasy
You poor old sod you see it's only me

Gm             Db   C   Db
Sitting on a park bench 
Eyeing little girls with bad intent

Snot is running down his nose 
Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes. 
hey, Aqualung  

Drying in the cold sun 
Watching as the frilly panties run. 
hey Aqualung 
Db  Eb  F
ooh Aqualung
