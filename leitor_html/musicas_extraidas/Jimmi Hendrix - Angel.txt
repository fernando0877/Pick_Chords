Angel came down from heaven yesterday,
A                        D               E        B A
 She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me

E       B          F#m               
And she told me a story yesterday,
A               D                           E                       
About the sweet love between the Moon, & the deep blue sea

A                        C           E                
 And then she spread her wings, high over me, 
E                     F#m   G#m       A
  she said shes gonna come, come back tomorrow

          And I said

D      /F#      Em     Bb         G     C  C#      D

E       B          F#m    
  Sure enough this morning came unto me,   
A                    D                  E             B  A
  silver wings silhouetted, against the child's sunrise
E       B          F#m              
 And my angel, she said unto me
A             D        E      
 today is the day, for you to rise

A                     C                      E                
  Take my hand, youre gonna be my man, youre gonna rise
E          F#m      G#m       A
  then she took me, high over yonder
