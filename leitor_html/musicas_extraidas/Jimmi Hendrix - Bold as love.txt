Bold as love
Jimmi Hendrix

A          E
  Anger,   he smiles,
 F#m                        D
towering in shiny metallic purple armour
       A              E
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
      F#m                            D      Asus2
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground

D               A                             Bm
  Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted,
             G
They quietly understand
D                    A                    Bm
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,
                    G    G#   A
But wonder why the fight is   on

            E            F#m   G    G# A
But they're all bold as love,
              E            F#m   G     G# A
Yeah, they're all bold as love
              E            F#m
Yeah, they're all bold as love
 D           A     Bm  D   G    G# A
Just ask the axis

    A          E                                    F#m
My red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war,
                D
and ribbons of euphoria

  A                 E
Orange is young, full of daring,
F#m                    D       C#
  But very unsteady for the first go round

 D                 A
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
Bm                               G
In fact I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
    D                      A
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from,
 Bm                  G            G# A    E
Giving my life to a rainbow like you, but i am

                         F#m    G     G# A
I'm bold bold as love,
       E                 F#m   G    G# A
Well I am bold, bold as love
  E           F#m
I am bold as love
 D             A     Bm      D
Just ask the axis   he knows everything,

 G G G    G# G# G#    A
yeah     yeah        yeeeeeah
