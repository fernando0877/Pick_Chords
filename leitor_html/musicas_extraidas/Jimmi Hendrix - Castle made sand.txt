Down the street you can hear her scream you're a disgrace
       Am 
As she slams the door in his drunken face
    Em7 
And now he stands outside
            F                  C                 G
And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool

F
He cries oh, girl you must be mad,
     Am
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?
        Em7 
Against the door he leans and starts a scene,
              F        C                       G
And his tears fall and burn the garden green

    G                  D                F            C  G
And so castles made of sand fall in the sea, eventually

A little Indian brave who before he was ten,
       Am 
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
       Em7 
And he built up a dream that when he grew up
         F             C                     G
He would be a fearless warrior Indian Cheif

     F 
Many moons past and more the dream grew strong until
A5                                            Em7
Tomorrow he would sing his first war song and fight his first battle
                                  F       C                                  G
But something went wrong, surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

    G                  D                   F            C     G
And so castles made of sand melts into the sea, eventually

      F 
There was a young girl, who's heart was a frown
          Am
Cause she was crippled for life,

And she couldn't speak a sound
        Em7                              F
And she wished and prayed she could stop living,
C                     G
So she decided to die

F#  F 
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
       A5 
And to her legs she smiled you wont hurt me no more
Em7
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
F      C                                G 
Look a golden winged ship is passing my way
                                  G   D   F  C   G
And it really didn't have to stop,            it just kept on going...
    G                  D                   C            C    
And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, eventually
