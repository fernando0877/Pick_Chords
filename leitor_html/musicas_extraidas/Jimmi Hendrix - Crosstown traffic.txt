Crosstown traffic
Jimmi Hendrix

Cm
  You jump in front of my car when you
F7
You know all the time that
Cm                                  F7
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
Bb7                       Eb
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain
Ab7                         G7
You say you just want me to take you for a ride

                 Cm
You're just like crosstown traffic
           F7
So hard to get through to you
Cm
Crosstown traffic
                F7
I don't need to run over you
Cm
Crosstown traffic
              F7
All you do is slow me down
        Bb
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town

Cm                              F7
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
Cm
Tire tracks all across your back
      F7
I can see you had your fun
Bb7                           Eb
But darling can't you see my signals turn from green to red
Ab7                                     G7
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead

                 Cm
You're just like crosstown traffic
           F7
So hard to get through to you
Cm
Crosstown traffic
                F7
I don't need to run over you
Cm
Crosstown traffic
              F7
All you do is slow me down
        Bb
And I'm trying to get on the other side of tow
