Little Wing
Jimmi Hendrix


           Em                  G
Well she's walking through the clouds
       Am                          Em
With a circus mind, That's running wild


Bm                           Am              
  Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
    C      G
And fairly tales,

F                           C
That's all she ever thinks about
           D
Riding the wind



               Em               G
Lord, When I'm sad she comes to me
                Am                      Em
With a thousand smiles, She gives to me free

Bm                               Am
It's alright, she says, It's alright
C                 G
Take anything you want from me
F           C              D
  Anything, Fly on, little wing
