Purple Haze

E7(#9)   G A

E7(#9)           G          A
Purple haze, all in my brain
Lately things, you don't seem the same
Actin' funny, but I don't know why
E                              (27 25 23, _34 23 13...)
'excuse me, while I kiss the sky

E7(#9)            G        A  
Purple haze, all around
Don't know, if I'm comin, up or down
Am I happy, or in misery?

E
What ever it is, that girl, put a spell on me
A        B       D   E7(#9)
Help me, Help me

E7(#9)                   A         B
Purple haze, all in my eyes,
Don't know, if it's, day or night
You got me blowin', blowin' my mind

E7(#9)
tomorrow, or just the end of time?
