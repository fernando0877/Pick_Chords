Spanish Casttle Magic
Jimmi Hendrix


B5
It's very far away
A#5             A5               G#5
It takes about half a day to get there
                  C#5
If we travel by my dragonfly
B5
No it's not in Spain
A#5                 A5                G#5
But all the same, you know, it's a groovy name
                    C#5
And the wind's just right, hey

F#5
Hang on my darling
C#5
Hang on if you want to go
G#5                             
You know it's really groovy place
F#5                             C#5
And it's just a little bit of Spanish castle magic

B5
The clouds are really low
A#5         A5           G#5
And they overflow with cotton candy
              C#5
And battlegrounds, red and brown
B5
But it's all in your mind
A#5         A5           G#5
Don't think your time on bad things
                      C#5
Just float your little mind around, look out

F#5
Hang on my darling
C#5
Hang on if you want to go
G#5                             
It puts everything else on the shelf
F#5                             C#5
Just a little bit of Spanish castle magic

Solo
C#5 

F#5
Hang on my darling
C#5
Hang on if you want to go
G#5                             
And it's happening, oh no, damn hey
F#5                             C#5
That's right baby, listen, a little bit of Spanish castle magic, hey


C#5
Little bit of Spanish castle magic, hey hey
I can't uh, sing this song, no
Yeah, okay baby, get on baby, yeah
It's all in your mind baby
Little bit of daydream here and there
