The wind it cries Mary
Jimmi Hendrix

C             B   Bb                 F
  After all the jacks are in their boxes
        C      B    Bb          F
And the clowns have all gone to bed
        C             B Bb              F
You can hear happiness    staggering on down the street
G          Bb            Eb E  F
Footprints dressed in red
        G    Bb       Eb E  F     Eb/G E/G#  F/A
And the wind whispers Mary

C         B  Bb            F
  A broom is drearily sweeping
       C             B  Bb              F
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
    C     B Bb       F
Somewhere a Queen is weeping
    G       Bb          Eb E  F
Somewhere a King has no wife
        G       Bb    Eb E  F     Eb/G E/G#  F/A
And the wind it cries Mary

C                    B    Bb             F
  The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow
    C                    B Bb           F
And shine their emptiness    down on my bed
         C      B Bb        F
The tiny island   sags downstream
          G                 Bb     Eb E  F
Cause the life that they lived is dead
        G    Bb      Eb E  F     Eb/G E/G#  F/A
And the wind screams Mary

C          B  Bb          F
  Will the wind ever remember
    C         B  Bb            F
The names it has blown in the past
              C           B   Bb           F
And with this crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
               G           Bb         Eb E  F
It whispers “No, this will be the last”
        G    Bb    Eb E  F     Eb/G E/G#  F/A
And the wind cries Mary

Eb E  F     Eb/G E/G#  F/A
