Voodoo Child 
Jimmi Hendrix

        E                          G  A
Well, I stand up, next to a mountain
A                                G          E 
i chop it down, with the edge of my hand (2x)

        Bm/D                       
Well I, pick up all, the pieces and make an island
A/C#                       E   G A      E   G  E
Might even, raise a little sand


             C7 
'Cause I'm a voodoo child
D7                   E  E
   Lord knows, i'm a voodoo child


        E                           G  A
I didn't mean, to take up all, your sweet time
I'll give it right back, to ya one of these days (2x)

          Bm/D                       
If i don't meet you no more, in this world
A/C#                                       E   G A      E   G  E
   I'll meet ya, on the next one, don't be late
