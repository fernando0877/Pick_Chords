I Can See Clearly Now
Jimmy Cliff

D            G               D           /
  I can see clearly now, the rain is gone
D              G          A
 I can see all obstacles, in my way
D             G                 D
 Gone are the dark clouds, that had me blind

                C       G                      D
It's gonna be a bright, bright, light sunshine day
                C       G                      D
It's gonna be a bright, bright, light sunshine day

D          G                D
I think I can make it now, the pain is gone,
D           G                 A
 All of the bad feelings have disappeared.
D            G          g         D
 Here is the rainbow I have been praying for.

                C       G                D
It's gonna be a bright, bright, sunshine day
                C       G                D
It's gonna be a bright, bright, sunshine day

F                                     C
 Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
F                                         A     C#m G C#m G C Bm A
 Look straight ahead, there's nothing but blue skiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiies
