I Love Rock And Roll
Joan Jett

E
I saw him dancing there by the record machine 
                         B
I knew he was a bit, about seventeen
A                   B    
The beat was going strong, 
E                  A
played my favorite song

And I could tell it, wouldn't be long


He goes with me, Yeah me!         
And I could tell it wouldn't be long
             B
He goes with me, Yeah me!

Singing: 
I love rock'n'roll 
so put another, dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock'n'roll 
so come and take your time, and dance with me!

E
He smiled, so I got up, and asked for his name
                                         B
That don't matter, he said, because it's all the same

A                B           E     A
Soon gonna take you home, where we can be alone

The next moving on

goes with me, Yeah me
                          B
Next we moving on goes with me, Yeah me!

  Soom gonna take you home
