If God had a name, what would it be?
              Em             C        
And would you call it to his face, 
G           D 
if you were faced with him?
   Em      C      G              D
In all his glory, what would you ask,
           Em       C     G     D
if you had just one question?

C           D
Yeah, yeah, God is great 
C           D
Yeah, yeah, God is good
C           D       
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

        Em      C      G   D
What if God was one of us?
       Em        C      G   D
Just a slob like one of us?
       Em       C      G             D            Em   C  G  D
Just a stranger on the bus trying to make his way home

   Em        C     G             D
If God had a face, what would it look like 
          Em          C    
And would you want to see,
G         D                    Em        C   
if seeing meant that you would have to believe, 
   G           D             Em            C          G       D
in things like heaven and in Jesus and the saints and all the prophets
Refrao yeah yeah:

               D            Em    C  G 
Just trying to make his way home...
       D            Em   C  G
Like a holy rolling stone
           D          Em   C  G
Back up to heaven all alone
               D             C
Just trying to make his way home...
                       C
Nobody calling on the phone
                               C
Except for the Pope, maybe in Rome.
