Imagine
John Lennon

C                 C7+   F
  Imagine there's no heaven
C          C7+      F
  its easy if, you try
C          C7+  F
  No hell below us
C          C7+    F
  Above us, only sky
F         C/E        Dm  Dm/C
  Imagine all the people
 G            G7
Living for today

C                 C7+     F
  Imagine there's no countries
C               C7+  F
  It isn't hard to   do
C                 C7+  F
  Nothing to kill, or die for
C           C7+   F
  And no religion too
F         C/E          Dm  Dm/C
  Imagine all the people
 G              G7
Living life in peace

F          G          C    E7
  You may say I'm a dreamer ----------
F          G           C    E7
  But I'm not the only one
F          G           C      E7
 I hope someday youâ€™ll join us
F          G          C        (Frase)
  And the world will be as one --------

C             C7+    F
  Imagine no possessions
C              C7+  F
  I wonder if, you  can
C                   C7+  F
  No need for greed, or  hunger
C               C7+  F
  A brotherhood of  man
F         C/E          Dm  Dm/C
  Imagine all the people
  G              G7
Sharing all the world
