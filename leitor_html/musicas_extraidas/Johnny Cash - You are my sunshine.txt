            A
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
             D                    A
You make me happy, when skies are gray
             D                      A
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
                      E         A
Please don't take, my sunshine away

          A                     A
The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping
            D               A
I dreamed I held you, in my arms
            D                    A
But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
                    E     A
So I hung, my head, and I cried.

            A                      A
I'll always love you, and make you happy,
            D             A
If you will only, say the same
           D                   A
But if you leave me, and love another,
                       E     A
You'll regret, it all, some day

            A
You told me once, dear, you really loved me
           D                   A
And no one else, could come between.
                D               A
But now, you've left me, to love another
                      E         A
You have shaaa-ttered all of my dreams
