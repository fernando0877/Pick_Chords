Love Will Tear Us Apart
Joy Division

(tom orig Em, tom bom Bm)
Em D/F# Bm A
         Em               D/F#
When the routine bites hard
      Bm           A
And ambitions are low
        Em           D/F#
And the resen-tments rides
     Bm           A
But emotions wont grow
         Em          D/F#
And were changin our ways,
      Bm        A
Takin different roads

     Em    D/F#               Bm     A
Then love, love will tear us apart again
Em    D/F#               Bm     A
Love, love will tear us apart again

           Em           D/F#
Why is the bedroom so cold
        Bm          A
Turned away on your side?
      Em          D/F#
Is my timing that flawed
       Bm          A
Our respect run so dry?
           Em                D/F#
Yet theres still this appeal
          Bm               A
That were kept through our lives

Em    D/F#               Bm     A
Love, love will tear us apart again 
Em    D/F#               Bm     A
Love, love will tear us apart again

       Em               D/F#
Do you cry out in your sleep
       Bm         A
All my failings expose?
      Em          D/F#
Get a taste in my mouth
        Bm           A
As desperation takes hold
      Em               D/F#
Is it somethin so good
          Bm          A
Just cant function no more?

     Em    D/F#               Bm     A
When love, love will tear us apart again
Em    D/F#               Bm     A
Love, love will tear us apart again
