Brown Eyed Girl
Kaau Crater Boys

D                 G  D              A7
 Hey where did we go, days when the rains came
D          G      D            A7
 Down in a hollow,   playing a new game
D               G                 D                A7 
 Laughing and a running whoa oh oh, Skipping and a jumping
D             G          D              A7             G
 In the misty morning fog, our hearts a thumpiiing and you,

A7              D    Bm  G      A7              D   
  My brown eyed girl,    You re my brown eyed girl 

D             G    D          A7
 Whatever happened, Tuesday's so slow
D                G       D           A7
 Going down the old mine, transistor radio
D                G                 D                A7
 Standing in the sunlight laughing, hiding behind a rainbow waltz
D              G       D          A7             G
 Kissing and a hugging, along the waterfall with you

A7              D    Bm G         A7           D   
  My brown eyed girl,    You re myy brown eyed girl 
A7                                D
 Do you remember when, we used to sing

D       G    D     A7
 Sha lalala ... la de da

D           G           D             A7
 So hard to find my way, now that I'm on my own
D                G         D           A7 
 Saw you just the other day, My how you, have grown
D            G                D                A7
Cant stop rememberin way back, sometimes I get overcome 

D                  G          D              A7         G
making love in the green grass, behind the stadium with you 
A7              D    Bm  G      A7              D   
  My brown eyed girl,    You re my brown eyed girl 
A7                                D
 Do you remember when, we used to sing 
 Sha lalala ... la de da
