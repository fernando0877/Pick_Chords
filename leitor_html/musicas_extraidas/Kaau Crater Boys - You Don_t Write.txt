You Don't Write
Kaau Crater Boys

G         Bm        C                        Cm
You don't write, and I been waitin' for your call
You say you busy, baby, but is that really all
Maybe it's just the loneliness that's driving me insane
When you used to play, or is it just a game

Am        D7       G
  If it's so, then we were meant to be
Am              D           G
  Then why, oh why, did you go away
             C    Bm  Am  D7
And leave me bluuuuuuuuuuuuue
          G     Bm  C  Cm
You don't write        
              G     Bm  C  Cm
No, you don't write        

G         Bm     C
You don't write, don't gimme no excuse
Sick and tired of all'a your abuse
So don't say you love me when you're miles and miles away
Cuz when the cat's away, the mice pretend to play
