Killing Me Softly (Fugees)
Lauryn hill

capo 1, tom orig Em, tom buba Am
Em                          Am7      
Strumming my pain, with his fingers. 
D7                       G
Singing my life with his words
Em                     A7
Killing me softly with his song. 
           D7           C
Killing me softly, with his song
           G                C
Telling my whole life, with his words
            F6           E7
Killing me softly,  with his song

Am7            D
    I heard he sang the good song
G              C
    I heard he had a style
Am7          D
    And so I came to see him
        Em
    And listen for a while
Am7              D7
    And there he was a young boy
G             B7
   A stranger to my eyes

Am7            D
    I felt all flushed, with fever
G               C
    Embarrassed by the crowd
Am7           D
    I felt he found my letters
        Em
    And read, each one out loud
Am7               D7
    I prayed that he would finish
G               B7
    But he just kept right ooon

Am7            D
    He sang as if knew me
G              C
    In all my dark despair
Am7              D
    And then he looked right through me
   Em
As if I wasn't there
Am7             D7
    And he just kept on singing
G             B7
    Singing clear and strong
