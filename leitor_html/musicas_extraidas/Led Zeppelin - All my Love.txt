Am  G  Dm   Am  G  D (2x)
Am             G            Dm
 Should I fall out, love my fire in the light
Am           G              D
To chase the feather in the wind
Am         G                  Dm
Within the glow that weaves, the cloak of delight
Am             G                  D
 There moves a thread that has no end

Am         G                   Dm
  For many hours and days that passes ever soon
Am              G                  D
 The tides have caused the flame to dim
Am          G                  Dm
At last the arm, is straight the hand to the loom
Am         G              D
Is this to end or just begin?

C               G/B
All of my Love, All of my Love
Am        G       F
All of my Love to You dear 

Am          G                    Dm
 The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
Am            G               D
 One voice is clear above the din
Am         G               Dm
  Proud Aryan, one word my will to sustain
Am          G                  D
 For me the cloth once more to spin

Am                G
Yours is the cloth,
           Dm
Mine is the hand that sews time
Am          G                 D
His is the force that lies wit hin
Am             G                         Dm
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
Am           G               D
He is the feather in the wind
