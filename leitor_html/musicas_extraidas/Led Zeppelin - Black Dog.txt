>> Hey mama said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
>> Ah child way you shake that thing
Gona make you burn, gona make you sting
>> Hey baby when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, I can't keep away
>> Oh yeah, oh yeah ah, ah, ah ah

I gotta roll I can't stand still
Got a flaming heart, cant get my fill
With eyes that shine, burning red
Dreams of you all through my head
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

Hey baby, whoa my baby, my pretty baby
Darling makes them do it now
Hey baby, oh my baby, my pretty baby
Move the way you're doing now

Didn't take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by down and out
Spent my money, took my car
Started tellin' her friends she gon' be a star
I don't know but I been told
A big legged woman ain't got no soul

All I ask for all I pray
Steady rollin' woman gon' come my way
Need a woman gonna hold my hand
Won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man
