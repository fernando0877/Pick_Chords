A  E      G    /  A   G  A
Ah caught you smiling at me,
E      G    /  A  G      A
That's the way it should be,
E    G  /   A  G    A     G  E
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine

Ah all the good times we had,
I sang love songs so glad
Always smiling, never sad, so fine

F#
  As we walk down, the country lanes,
        A
I'll be singing a song,
                     E
hear me calling your name
F#
 Hear the wind within the trees,
        A                   
Telling mother nature, 'bout you and me

A  E      G    /  A   G  A
Well if the sunshine's so bright,
Or on our way it's darkest night
The road we choose, is always right, so fine

Ah can your love be so strong
When so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on, and on, and on and on and on?

Refr√£o

My, my la de la 
come on now it ain't too far,
Tell your friends all around the world,
Ain't no companion 
like a blue eyed merle

Come on now, well let me tell you,
What you're missing, missing, 
'round them brick walls

A  E      G    /  A   G  A
So of one thing I am sure,
It's a friendship so pure,
Angels singing all around My dog, is so fine

Yeah, ain't but one thing to do
Spend my nat'ral life with you,
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine

F#
  When you're old and your eyes are dim,
There ain't no old shep gonna happen again,
F#
We'll still go walking down country lanes,
I'll sing the same old songs, hear me call your name
