C     Am       F   G                  C
oh oh oh oh oh oh, You don't have to go

ay ay ay ay ay ay, All those tears I cry

       Am                   G
When I read the letter, you wrote me

Made me, mad mad mad

       Am                     G
When I read the words, That it told me

Made me sad sad sad

Am                      
 But I still love, you so
G                 F 
  I can't let you go,
            G
I love you, ooh baby I love you


C     Am       F  G                   C
oh oh oh oh oh oh, Every breath I take

oh oh oh oh oh, Every move, I make
     Am      F G           Am
oh oh oh oh oh, Baby please don't go

C     Am       F       G              C
ay ay ay ay ay ay, You hurt me, to my soul

oh oh oh oh oh, You hurt me, to my soul

oh oh oh oh oh, Darling please, don't go
