 Dancing days are here again,
C
 Summer evenings grow.
C                   C#
 I got my flower, I got my power,
C
  I got a woman who knows.   0:33

C                     Bb
  I said it's alright, You know it's alright,
A
I guess it's all in my heart

C                  Bb
You'll be my only, My one and only,
A
Is that the way it should start?

C              C#
Crazy ways are evident,
       C
In the way you wearin' your clothes.
                 C#
Sippin' booze is precedent,
       C
As the evening starts to glow.  1:06

C                    Bb
You know it's alright, I said it's alright,
A
You know it's all in my heart.

C                  Bb
You'll be my only, My one and only,
A
Is that the way it should start?

C                      C#
You told your mama I'd get you home,
        C 
But you didn't say that I had no car.
                     C#
I saw a lion, he was standin' alone,
       C 
With a tadpole in a jar.   1:55

C                    Bb
You know it's alright, I said it's alright,
A
I guess it's all in my heart, heart, heart

C                  Bb
You'll be my only, My one and only,
A
Is that the way it should start?

C                   C#
So dancing days are here again,
       C 
As the summer evenings grow

C                        C#
  You are my flower, you are my power,
    C 
You are my woman who knows.  (2:27)

C                     Bb
  I said it's alright, You know it's alright,
A
You know it's all in my heart.

C                  Bb
You'll be my only, My one and only,
A
Is that the way it should start?
I know it is that.  2:44
