Going to California
Led Zeppelin

G7+
Spent my days, with a woman unkind, 
                                 D
smoked my stuff, and drank,  all wine


Made up my mind, to make a new start,

going to California, with an aching, in my heart


Someone told me, theres a girl out there,
                                                Dm7   Bm7(b5)  D   D
with love in her eyes, and flowers, in her hair

G7+
Took my chances, on a big jet plane,

never let them tell you, that they're, aaall, the same


The sea was red, and the sky was grey, 

wondered how tomorrow, could ever, follow today


The mountains and the canyons, started to tremble and shake

As the children of the sun, begin....to awake

Dm
Seems that the wrath,

of the gods, got a punch

on the nose, and it started, and to flow
                    A7
I think, I might be sinking

Dm
Throw me a line

if I reach , it in time

I'll meet you, up there, where the path
                     A7     D
Runs straight... and high.

G7+
To find a queen, without a king,

they say she plays guitar, and cries as she sings, lalalala


Ride a white mare, in the footsteps of dawn,

Tryin to find a woman, who's never never never, been born


Standing on a hill, in my mountain of dreams

                                                     Dm7  Bm7(b5)  D   D
Telling myself, its not as hard hard hard, as it seems
