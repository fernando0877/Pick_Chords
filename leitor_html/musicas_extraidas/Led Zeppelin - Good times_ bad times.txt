Good times, bad times

    In the days, of my youth,
          D             A             E - - D - A
    I was told, what it means, to be a man
    E
    Now I've reached that age,
                  D             A                  E - - D - A
    I've tried to do, all those things, the best I can.
       E                           D             A         E - - D - A
    No matter how I try, I find my way, into the same, old jam.

Good times, bad times, you know I had my share,
        B7                     E
when my woman left home, for a brown-eyed man,
        B7
well, I still don't seem to care.

    Sixteen, I fell in love, with a girl, as sweet as could be,

    it only took a couple of days, till she was rid of me.

    She swore that she would be, all mine, and love me till the end,

    but when I whispered, in her ear, I lost another friend, oooh.

    Oh, I know what it means to be alone,
E                          D     A
    I sure do wish I was at home.
E                         D             A
    I don't care what the neighbors say,
E                          D                A
    I'm gonna love you, each and every day.
      E                               D    A
    You can feel, the beat within my heart.
      E                        D                A
    realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part....
