F#m7 F#m6(b5)  F#m7 (004540)
ooooooooooooh  oooo 
   E7
We come from the land, of the ice and snow,
from the midnite sun, where the hot springs blow
    F#m7          F#m6(b5)
The hammer of the gods
F#m7                    F#m6(b5)
will drive our ships to new lands
   F#m7             F#m6(b5)
to fight the horde, singing and crying
E7                    F#m7
  Vahala, I am comiiiiing

A            B7
on we sweep, with treshing oar,
C
our only goal will be the west-ern shore

E7
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
from the midnite sun where the hot springs blow.
    F#m7               F#m6(b5)
How soft your fields so green,
    F#m7              F#m6(b5)
can whisper tales  of gore,
   F#m7               F#m6(b5)
of how we calmed, the tides of war
E7
We are your over lords.

A            B7
on we sweep, with treshing oar,
C
our only goal will be the west-ern shore

So now you'd better stop
and rebuild your ruins,
for peace and trust, can win the day despite
despite of all your losing.
