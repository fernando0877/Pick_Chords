Oh let the sun, beat down upon my face, stars fill my dream
I am a traveler of, both time and space, to be where I have been
Sit with elders of a gentle race, swirl but seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait, all will be revealed

Offer song from tongues of lilting grace, sounds caress my ear

Not a word I heard could I relate, the story was quite clear
Whoa  oh,  Whoa oh

Oooo baby I've been flying
Oh yea, baby there ain't no denying
Oooo yea, I've been flying
G5                 A5           G5             A5
All I see turns to brown, as the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand, as I scan this racy land

O my love the storm who leaves no trace, like thoughts inside a dream
Hear the band that led me to that place, yellow desert screams
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again
As the dust that floats behind you, we're moving through kashmir

O' father of the four winds fill my sails, cross the sea of years
With no provisions but an open face, beyond the straits of fear
Whoa  oh o,  Whoa oh o

n my way, yea
When I feel, when I think my brain to stay
OOOH yea  OOOH yea when I'm down
OOOH yea  OOOH yea when I'm down
OH my baby, OH my baby let me take you there
Let me take you there....
