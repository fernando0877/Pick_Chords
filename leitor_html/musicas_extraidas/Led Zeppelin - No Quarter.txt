C#m
Close the door, put out the light. 
You know they won't be home tonight.
C#m
The snow falls hard and don't you know? 
The winds of Thor are blowing cold

C#m                                     A
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
                              Dsus2
They carry news that must get through.
Dsus2                                C#m
They choose the path where no-one goes.

C#m7          C#m     F#7 C#m7
They hold no quarter (2x)

C#m
Walking side by side with death, 
The devil mocks their every step
C#m
The snow drives back the foot that's slow, 
The dogs of doom are howling more
C#m                           A      
They carry news that must get through,
                            Dsus2
To build a dream for me and you
Dsus2                                 C#m
They choose the path where no-one goes.

C#m7          C#m     F#7 C#m7
They hold no quarter.
C#m7          C#m     F#7 C#m7
They ask no quarter

C#m7          C#m   F#7 C#m7
The pain, the pain without quarter.
C#m7          C#m  F#7 C#m7
They ask no quarter.
C#m7          C#m    F#7 C#m7
The dogs of doom are howling more!
