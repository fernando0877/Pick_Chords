It's been a long time, since I rockn rolled,
It's been a long time, since I did the Stroll.

Let me get it back (3x)
                  A7
baby where I come from


     E7
It's been a long time, been a long time,
D
lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time


     A
It's been a long time, since book of love,
I can't count the tears, of a life with no love

D
Carry me back (3x)
                  A7
baby where I come from

 A
Seems so long, since we walked, in the moonlight,
Making vows, just can't work right

D
Open your arms (3x)
                  A
let my love, come running in
