           Am         E
There's a lady who's sure
           C          D
All that glitters is gold
           F                      G/B  Am
And she's buying the stairway to hea__ven

          Am              E
When she gets there she knows
         C              D
If the stores are all closed
        F                         G/B  Am
With a word she can get what she came for

C   D   F  Am
  Uuuhh
           C         G          D4   D
And she's buying a stairway to hea__ven
           C           D
There's a sign on the wall
         F           Am
But she wants to be sure
             C             D              F
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings

       Am          E
In a tree by the brook
           C            D
There's a songbird who sings
          F                           G/B  Am
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgi___ven

( Am  E  C  D  F  G/B  Am  G/B )

Am   D4    D                 Am    Em  D  C  D
            Oh, it makes me wonder
Am   D4    D
Oh,           it makes me wonder

( Am7  Em  D  C  D )

C           G/B
 There's a feeling I get
        Am
When I look to the west
         C         G/B       F    Am
And my spirit is crying for lea__ving

        C              G/B
In my thoughts I have seen
           Am
Rings of smoke through the trees
         C          G/B            F    Am  C  G/B
And the voices of those who stand loo__king

Terceira Parte:

Am   D4   D                Am    Em  D  C  D
            Oh, it makes me wonder
Am   D4   D
Oh,           it makes me wonder
( Am   Em  D  C  D )

           C             G/B
And it's whispered that soon
      Am
If we all call the tune
          C          G/B        F    Am
Then the piper will lead us to rea__son

       C            G/B
And a new day will dawn
      Am
For those who stand long
         C           G/B        F    Am  C  G/B
And the forests will echo with laughter

Am  D4  D  Am  Em  D  C  D

C               G/B            Am
  If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
C                G/B                F    Am
  It's just a spring clean for the may queen

C                 G/B              Am
  Yes there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
C                G/B                F          Am
  There's still time to change the road you're on

( C  G/B )

Am   D4     D                  Am    Em  D  C  D
              And it makes me wonder

( Am  D4  D  Am  Em  D  C  D )
C               G/B            Am
  Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know
C              G/B            F7M  Am
  The piper's calling you to join him

C            G/B              Am
  Dear lady can you hear the wind blow
And did you know
C                G/B          F    Am       C  G/B
  Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

        C  G/B

 Am  G  F
Am            G                F   G
   And as we wind on down the road
Am              G               F   G
   Our shadows taller than our soul
Am                G            F  G
   There walks a lady we all know

Am                   G                   F  G
   Who shines white light and wants to show
Am            G                   F   G
   How everything still turns to gold
Am             G           F   G
   And if you listen very hard
Am                G              F   G
   The tune will come to you at last

Am              G           F            G
   When all are one and one is all, yeah
Am          G               F
   To be a rock and not to roll
( Am  G  F ) (4x)
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
