I ooonly find it slips, away to grey,
    Am          G        D
The hours, they bring me pain.

  Tangerine, Tangerine,
G           D        C             D
  Living reflections, from a dream;
G         D    C                 D
I was her love, she was my queen,
G                              D
   And now a thousand years between.

Am   A4   Am     G       D
Thinking  how it used to be,
Am   A4   Am      G      D     C    C    /B Am
Does she still remember times like these?
   Am       G   D
To think of us again?

And I do.
