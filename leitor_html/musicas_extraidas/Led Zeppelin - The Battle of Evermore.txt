The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom, and walked the night alone

  I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, waiting for the eastern glow


    Am        G   Am         C    Am           G  Am   C
The apples of the valley hold the seeds of happiness

The ground is rich from tender care, repay, do not forget

The apples turn to brown and black, the tyrant's face is red

The sky is filled with good and bad that mortals never know

G7                   C       G7                      C
  Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow

The pain of war cannot exceed the woe of th' aftermath

The drums will shake the castle wall, the Ringwraiths ride in black, ride..

No comfort has the fire at night that lights the face so cold
