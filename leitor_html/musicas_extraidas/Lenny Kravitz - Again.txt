Again
Lenny Kravitz


D9                  E    F#
   I've been searching for you
D9                E      F#
   I heard a cry within my soul
     D9                                     E    F#
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
D9                                 E    F#
Now here you are, walking right through my door

A9            F#m               E
    All of my life, Where have you been
            D
I wonder if I'll, ever see you again
    A                    F#m
And if that day comes, I know we could win
  E                    D
I wonder if I'll, ever see you again

D9              E    F#
A sacred gift of heaven
D9                  E    F#
For better, worse, wherever
   D9                          E          F#
And I would never let somebody break you down
D9                 E  F#
Or take your crown never

refr√£o:

F
I've searched through time, I've always known
     Em
That you were there upon your throne
  F
A lonely queen without her king
     Em
I've longed for you, my love forever
