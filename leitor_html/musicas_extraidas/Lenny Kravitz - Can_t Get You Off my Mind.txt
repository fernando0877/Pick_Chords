Can't Get You Off my Mind
Lenny Kravitz

(gaita G)
G
Life is just a lonely highway
I'm out here on the open road
Am
I'm old enough to see behind me
But young enough to feel my soul

G
I don't wanna lose you baby
And I don't wanna be alone
Am                  /
Don't wanna live my days without you
        Am               /
But for now, I've got to be, without you

C                             D
  I've got a pocket full of money
C                      D
  And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds
C                      G
  But when it comes to lovin'
   D                         C          G  /
I just can't, get you off my mind, yeah

G               Am        
  Baaaabe can't you see, this is killing me

G               /
  I don't wanna push you baby
G                     /
  And I don't want to be told
Am                       /
  It's just that I can't breathe without you
Am                   /
  Feel like Iâ€™m gona lose control

C                             D
  I've got a pocket full of money
C                      D
  And a pocket full of keys that have no bounds
C                      G
  But when it comes to lovin'
   D                         C          G  /
I just can't, get you off my mind, yeah
