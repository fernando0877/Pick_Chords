Fly Away
Lenny Kravitz

A    B           C
   I wish that I could fly
  G               D
Into the sky, So very high

A        B      C          G  D
    Just like a dragonfly

A        B    C
     I'd fly above the trees
 G                D
Over the seas, In all degrees
A      B  C         
    To anywhere I please, Oh

A        B  C      
  I want to get away
G            D    A
   I want to fly away
B   C      G      D
  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah

A        B      C
  Let's go and see the stars
     G            D
The milky way, or even Mars

A       B         C           G  D
  Where it could just be ours

A        B      C
  Let's fade into the sun
           G
Let your spirit fly, Where we are one
A       B     C
  Just for a little fun
G       D
  Oh oh   oh yeah
