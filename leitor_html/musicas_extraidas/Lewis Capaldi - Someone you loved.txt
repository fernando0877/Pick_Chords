Someone you loved
Lewis Capaldi

C                        G                                Am     F
  I'm going under in the sum, I fear there's no one to save me
C                            G                        Am     F
  This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
                     C                 G 
I need somebody-dy heal, somebody to know, 
              Am                F
somebody to have, somebody to hold
              C                      G
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
                Am                                F
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

                C             G
Now the day bleeds, into nightfall
                 Am                         F
And you're not hi-is, in get me through it all
                  C                          G
I let my gard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Am                         F
I was getting kinda used to being so i’m you lo-oved

C                          G                               Am     F
   I'm going underand this time I fear there's no one to turn to
C                            G                           Am     F
  This all or nothing way of lovin' got me sleepin' without you

                      C                 G 
I need somebody to know, somebody to heal,
              Am                         F
somebody to have, just to know how it feels
              C                      G
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
                Am                             F
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape

Refrão

    Dm          Am        
And Iiiii, send close my eyes,
         G                 Am         
when it hurts sometimes, I fall into your
Dm           Am                         G
Arms I'll be safe in your sound, 'til I come back around

                C                G
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 Am                        F
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  C                          G
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Am                         F
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

                    C                G
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 Am                        F
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  C                          G
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Am                         F
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
