Gm                                    F
When you first left me, I was wanting more
                          Gm
But you were fucking that girl next door
                   F
What'd you do that for? (what'd you do that for?)

Gm                                            F
When you first left me, I didn't know what to say
                     Gm
I'd never been on my own that way
            F
Just sat by myself all day

Gm
I was so lost back then
F
But with a little help from my friends
Gm                                      F
I found the light in the tunnel at the end

Gm
Now you're calling me up on the phone
F
So you can have a little whine and a moan
Gm                                     F
And it's only because you're feeling alone

Gm                       F
At first, when I see you cry
            Gm                        F
It makes me smile, Yeah it makes me smile
   Gm                      F
At worst, I feel bad for awhile
                Gm                     F
But then I just smile, I go ahead and smile

Gm                                    F
Whenever you see me, You say that you want me back
                  Gm                            F
And I tell you it don't mean jack, No, it don't mean jack
  Gm
I couldn't stop laughing, No, I just couldn't help myself
                      Gm                          F
See, you messed up my mental health, I was quite unwell
