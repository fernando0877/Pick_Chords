Long tall Sally
Little Richard

          F
I'm gonna tell Aunt Mary 'bout Uncle John
He claims he has the misery but he has a lot of fun

   Bb         F        C              Bb                F
Oh baby, yeah baby, wo baby, we'll be havin' some fun tonight

Well, long tall Sally, she's built for speed
She's got everything that Uncle John needs


   Bb         F        C              Bb                F
Oh baby, yeah baby, wo baby, we'll be havin' some fun tonight


I saw Uncle John with bald-headed Sally
He saw Aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley

F
We're gonna have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Bb
Have some fun tonight
F
Everything's all right
C              Bb               F
Have some fun, yeah, some fun tonight
