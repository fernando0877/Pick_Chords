     C#m          B                  C#m           B
So many people
I know only a few
Yes I may say that I love this man, and that man
what keeps me from loving you?

Date of birth, geography
The color of my skin, ideology
You got ten fingers, two legs, one nose
Like me, just like me

           A                   G#
And its as simple as that, you see

         C#m                       B
And if I dont know who to love, I love them all
         C#m                        B
And if I dont know who to trust, I trust them all
       C#m                  B                        G#   A    B
And if I dont know who to kill, I may kill myself instead

From the mouth of a baby
Will come the world saving words, That will save us all
From the lungs of a child
Will come the everlasting breath of God

Increasing peace and honesty
And not carrying on despite of me, ohh no
Dont you know, This aint about no race, no creed
No race, no creed

           A                   G#
And its as simple as that, you see
         C#m                       B
And if I dont know who to love, I love them all
         C#m                        B
And if I dont know who to trust, I trust them all
       C#m                  B                        G#   A    B
And if I dont know who to kill, no suicide, Im already dead, yeahhh


And it's as simple as that
