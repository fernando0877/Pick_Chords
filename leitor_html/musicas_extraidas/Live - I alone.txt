and measure these things in your eyes
I've long to be here by his resolve
alone in the church by and by
to cradle the baby in space
and leave you here by yourself, chained to fate

oh, now we took it back too far,
and love can save now, 
all these riddles that you burn
all come runnin' back to you, 
all these rhythms that you hide
only love can save us now, 
all these riddle that you burn
yeah, yeah, yeah
