I know that I should, think about giving 
and thinking about, helping out, think about 
think about living, but i-i-i-i, 
can't seem to rescue myself (2x)

              E                           
what about my bank account, 
       G    A      D
and my holy desert shield,
              F#             G
that keeps me dry under the aaarms
A                                 D
flags and mental jewelry, is all i know
                 F#                E7 (intro)
and they keep me happy and warm inside

So I said unto this man
"who are you and, where do you come from?"

Can he proceeded to tell me, many, many, many, many, 
many, many, many things, 
But I said: nothing at all

For the flower in the corner, 
by the room in the window and the sun, 
Said it all

Refrão 
              G                          
at least they said they would,
          F#
said they could

mama said they 
G             F#
would, do me good
                G
ohhh.. ahhh .. iê
