Heard alot of talk about the ocean
heard alot of talk about the sea
heard alot of talk about alot of things
never meant that much to me

Ebm                               C#
heard alot of talk about my spirit
heard alot of talk about my soul
but i decided that anxiety and pain
were better friends
            G#
so i let it go

               Ebm        Bbm

let's get it back, let's get it back together.

heard alot of talk about this jesus
a man of love, a man of strength
but what a man was, two thousand years ago
means nothing at all, to me today

he could have been telling me, about my higher self
but he only lives, inside my prayer
so what he was, may have been beautiful
but the pain, is right now,  and right here
