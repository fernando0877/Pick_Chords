   And to love       a   god
G  G      D   Dsus4  D   Em
   And to fear       a   flame
          Bm    C
   And to burn,  A crowd that has a name

G  G      D   Dsus4  D   G
   And to right       or wrong
G  G      D   Dsus4  D   Em
   and to meek        or strong
        Bm                  C
   it is known, just scream it from a wall

D            D            D          D
I've willed, I've walked, I've read, I've talked
D       D       D
I know, I know, I've been here before.

Em       A            Em
Hey, now we won't be raped
Em       A            Em
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that
Em       A            Em
Hey, now we won't be raped
Em       A             C
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that

G  G      D   Dsus4  D     G
  It's the song     that burns
G  G      D   Dsus4  D     Em
  It's the wheel    that turns
          Bm    C
It's the way    we sing that makes them dream
G  G      D   Dsus4  D     G
And to Christ,       a   cross
G  G   D   Dsus4     D     Em
And to me,           a chair
         Bm              C
I will sit and earn the ransom from up here
