The Beauty of Gray
Live

 Am                        E
     If I told you he was your brother
 Am                                E
 We could reminisce then you would go about your day
 Am                       E
 If I said you ought to give him some of your water
       Am                          E
 You'd shake your canteen and walk away.

      F                                C   G    F
 The perception that divides you from him is a lie
           C          G           F
 For some reason you never asked why
          C                G      F
 This is not a black and white world
            C           G             Bb
 You can't afford to believe in your side

          Am                    Dm
 This is not a black and white world
         Am                         E
 To be alive I say the colors must swirl
         Am                 Dm
 And I believe that maybe today
         C                G
 We will all, get to appreciate
                Am      E       Am       E
 The beauty of gray

...
          C               G
 We will all get to appreciate

                 Am    Dm                  C    G
 The beauty of gray        The beauty of gray
                 Am    Dm                  C    G
 The beauty of gray        The beauty of gray

 
 Look into your eyes

 No daylight

 New day now

         Am          Dm
 This is not...
