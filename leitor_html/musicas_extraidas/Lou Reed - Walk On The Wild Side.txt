Walk On The Wild Side
Lou Reed

C                       F
Holly came from Miami FLA,Hitch-Hiked way across the USA
C                    Dm         
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
F                        Dm
Shaved her legs and then he was a she

C                                       F
She says: Hey babe,Take a walk on the wild side
Said: Hey honey, Take a walk on the wild side
  
Candy came from out on the Island
In the back room she was everybody's darling
But she never lost her head,Even when she was giving head

Little Joe never once gave it away,Everybody had to pay and pay
A hustle here, and a hustle there,New York City's the place

Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
Looking for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the Apollo You should've seen them go go go

Jackie is just speeding away,
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Then I guess she had to crash,
Valium would have helped that bash
C                                       F
She says: Hey babe,Take a walk on the wild side
Said: Hey honey, Take a walk on the wild side
And the colored girls say, Doo do doo do doo do do doo
