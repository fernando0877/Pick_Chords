Nobody Knows The Trouble I've Seen
Louis Armstrong

F7+
  Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
                Bb
Nobody knows my sorrow
F7+                 Dm
  Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Bb    C7
Glory hallelujah

F7+   
Sometimes I'm up, Sometimes I'm down
Bb       C7
Oh, yes, lord
F7+
Sometimes I'm almost, to the ground
Bb  C7   F7+
Oh, yes, lord


F7+
Although you see, me goin' 'long so
Bb       C7
Oh, yes, lord
F7+
I have my trials here below
Bb  C7   F7+
Oh, yes, lord
