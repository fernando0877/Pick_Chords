I see trees of green,    red roses too
Gm7           F      A7             Dm
   I see them bloom,     for me and you,
      Db              Gm7         C7        F      B7-5   Bbmaj7   C7  
And I think to myself,    what a  wonderful world.

I see skies of blue      and clouds of white,
Gm7                   F     A7                 Dm
   The bright blessed day,     the dark sacred night,
