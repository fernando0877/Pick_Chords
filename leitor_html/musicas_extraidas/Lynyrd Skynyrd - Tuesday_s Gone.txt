Tuesday's Gone
Lynyrd Skynyrd

G          D7  Em          C
Train roll on, on down the line won't you,
G              D7       C
Please take me far, far away.
G                   D7     Em         C
Now I feel the wind blow, outside my door,
G             D         C
I leave my woman, at home.

   G         F              C
   Tuesday's gone, with the wind
   G       D7             C
   My baby gone, with the wind

G           D7    Em            C
And I don't know, oh where I'm going,
G              D7         C
I just want to be, left alone.
G               D7   Em          C
When this train ends, I will try again,
G          D7        C
I leave my woman, at home.

G          D7  Em                 C
Train roll on, many miles from my home
G        D7                C
See, I'm riding, my blues away.
G            D7   Em            C
Tuesday, you see, she had to be free,
G       D7                     C
But somehow, I've got to carry on
