Once ooour valleys were ringing,
     G      G9      G       G4
With sounds of our children singing,
    C   G/D   F7+            Em
But now sheep bleat till the evening,
    F7+             Em        Am
And sheelings stand empty and broken

Where was our fierce highland mettle,
    G   G9       G          G4
Our men once so fearless in battle,
    C     G/D    F7+          Em
Now stand cowed, huddled like cattle,
    F7+         Em              Am
And wait to be shipped ower the ocean
