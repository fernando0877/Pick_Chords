I Need You to Turn To (Elton John)
Maddy Prior

Am           C7+
You're not a shiiip
   Am         C7+
to carryyy my life
        D            Am  
You are nailed to my love
   C      G        Am    
in maaany looonely nights

     Am               C7+
I've strayed from the cottages
   Am           C7+
to found myself here
    D           Am  
For I need your love
      C         G          Am   
your loooove proteeects my fears
------
      C          Am
And I wonder sometimes
      C          Am
and I know I'm unkind
      Em          Am
But I need you to turn to
     G
when I act so blind

    C             Am
but I need you to turn to
     C         C
when I lose control
       Em            Am
You're my guardian angel
    G        C  /B      Am  
who keeeeeps oooout the cold
------
        Am               C7+
Did you paint your smile on,
     Am           C7+
well  I   said I knew
    D         Am    
my reason for living
     G               Am 
Is   fooor  loooving you

      Am          C7+
We're relaated in feeling
    Am           C7+
but you're high above
       D               Am    
You're pure and you're gentle
         C       G      Am  
with the graaace ooof a dove
