  C               Dm               Am                    G7
I met my love, at Woolwich Pier, beneath the big, crane standing
    C                  Dm                 Am              G7
And all the love, that felt for her ,it passed all, understanding
G                 F             C          G7
Took her sailing, on the river, flow sweet river flow
G                F                  C    G7          C
London town, was mine to give her, sweet Thames flow softly

C                 Dm          Am           G7
Made the Thames into a crown, flow sweet, river flow
C                Dm     Em     F    C           G7     C
Made a brooch of Silver town, sweet Thames flow sooooftly,
 F    C           G7  C
sweet Thames flow softly

  C               Dm                Am                    G7
At London Yard, I held her hand, at Blackwell Point, I faced her
       C               Dm                    Am          G7
At the Isle of Dogs, I kissed her mouth, and tenderly, embraced her
G                    F                 C           G7
Heard the bells, of Greenwich ringing, flow sweet, river flow
G                 F                  C     G7         C
All the time, my heart was singing, sweet Thames flow softly

C                  Dm              Am          G7
Limehouse Reach, I gave her there, flow sweet, river flow
C            Dm            F     C           G7  C
As a ribbon, for her hair, sweet Thames flow softly,
 F    C           G7     C
sweet Thames flow sooooftly



From Putney Bridge to Nine Elms Reach, we cheek to cheek, were dancing
A necklace made, of London Bridge, her beauty was enhancing

Kissed her once, again at Wapping, flow sweet, river flow

After that, there was, no stopping, sweet Thames flow softly

Gave her Hampton Court to twist, flow sweet river flow

Into a bracelet for her wrist, sweet Thames flow softly

sweet Thames flow softly

But now, alas, the tide has changed, 
my love she has gone from me
And winter's frost has touched my heart and put a blight upon me
Creeping fog is on the river, 
flow sweet river flow
Sun and moon and stars gone with her, 
sweet Thames flow softly
Swift the Thames runs to the sea, 
flow sweet river flow
Bearing ships and part of me, 
sweet Thames flow softly
