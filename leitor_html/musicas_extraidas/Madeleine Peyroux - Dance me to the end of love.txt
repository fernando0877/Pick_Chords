Am
Dance me to your beauty
       Em
With a burning violin
Am
Dance me through the panic
         Em
Till I'm gathered safely in
Am
Lift me like an olive branch

And beeeee  my home dove

Am
Let me see your beauty
         Em
When the witnesses are gone
Am
Let me feel you moving
          Em
Like they do in Babylon
Am
Show me slowly what I only
Em
Know the limits of

Who are asking to be born

Though every thread is torn

Touch me with your naked hand
Em
Touch me with your glove
