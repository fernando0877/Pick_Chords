Like a Prayer
Madonna


   Dm        C Gm Dm
   Life is a mystery
   Dm            C     Gm   Dm
   Everyone must stand a - lone
   Dm         C    Gm  F
   I hear you call my name
   Bb     F     C     Dm
   And it feels like home


   F                 C
   When you call my name
                         Bb
   It's like a little prayer
                    Am
   I'm down on my knees
           Dm   C   F
   I wanna take you there
   F                C
   In the midnight hour
                     Bb
   I can feel your power
                  Am
   Just like a prayer
                 Dm   C   Bb
   You know I'll take you there


   Bb           F
   I hear your voice
   C            Dm
   It's like an angel sighing
   Bb        F                  C
   I have no choice I hear your voice
   C
   Feels like flying
   Bb           F
   I close my eyes
   C            Dm
   Oh God I think I'm falling
   Bb        F                   C
   Out of the sky, I close my eyes
   C
   Heaven help me



   F                 C
   When you call my name
                         Bb
   It's like a little prayer
                    Am
   I'm down on my knees
           Dm   C   F
   I wanna take you there
   F                C
   In the midnight hour
                     Bb
   I can feel your power
                  Am
   Just like a prayer
                 Dm   C   Bb
   You know I'll take you there


   Bb           F
   Like a child
   C            Dm
   You whisper softly to me
   Bb        F                  C
   You're in control just like a child
   C
   Now I'm dancing
   Bb           F
   It's like a dream
   C            Dm
   No end and no beginning
   Bb        F
   You're here with me it's like a dream
   C
   Let the choir sing


   F                 C
   When you call my name
                         Bb
   It's like a little prayer
                    Am
   I'm down on my knees
           Dm   C   F
   I wanna take you there
   F                C
   In the midnight hour
                     Bb
   I can feel your power
                  Am
   Just like a prayer
                 Dm   C   Bb
   You know I'll take you there
