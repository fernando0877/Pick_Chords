            Dm      Gm
Calling all angels, Here to guide you
            Dm           Gm    A7
Calling all angels To surround you
            Dm        Gm
Calling all angels,To walk beside you
             Dm            A7
Love may you walk,On solid ground,On solid

Dm
All of your cards, Are out on the table
Gm
Each of your bags, neatly packed
Dm
Horses are drawn, and out of the stables
Gm                      A7
Now there is no looking back

Dm
Each in our own,Each one in our time
     Gm
Will find our way bac, to the source
Dm
Know as you go,I am right here behind you
Gm                     A7
Loving you living your choice
