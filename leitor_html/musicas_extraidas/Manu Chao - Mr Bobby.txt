Am            Dm          Em
  Sometimes i dream about reality
  Sometimes i feel so down
  Sometimes i dream about a wild wild world
  Sometimes i feel so lonesome

Hey bobby marley sing something good to me   yeahh
This world go crazy, it's an emergency     whoaaa

Tonight i dream about fraternity
Tonight i say one day

One day my dreams will be reality
like Bobby said to me

Hey bobby marley sing something good to me   yeahh
This world go crazy, it's an emergency     whoaaa

Tonight i watch through my window
And I can't see no light
Tonight I watch through my window
And I can't see no right
