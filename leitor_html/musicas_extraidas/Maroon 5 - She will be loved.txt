Am                G
  Beauty queen of only eighteen, she
  Am                 G
 had some trouble with herself
Am              G
  He was always there to help her, she
   Am                  G
always belonged to someone else

Am            G
  I drove for miles and miles
    Am               G
And wound up at your door
Am             G                 Am
  I’ve had you so many times but somehow
       G
I want more

C                       G
  I don’t mind spending everyday
Am                          G
  Out on your corner in the pouring rain
C                            G
  Look for the girl with the broken smile
Am                        F
  Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

        C       G
And she will be loved
        Am      F
And she will be loved

Am                 G
  Tap on my window knock on my door
 Am                     G
I want to make you feel beautiful
Am                 G
  I know I tend to get so insecure
Am                  G
  It doesn’t matter anymore

Am                G
  It’s not always rainbows and butterflies
     Am                        G
It’s compromise that moves us along, yeah
Am                        G
  My heart is full and my door’s always open
        Am               G
You can come anytime you want

refrao:

Am                 G
  I know where you hide 
              Am
Alone in your car
                G                              Am
Know all of the things that make you who you are
                G                    Am
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
                       G                       F
Comes back and begs me catch her every time she falls... yeah

Am                 G
  Tap on my window knock on my door
  Am                    G
I want to make you feel beautiful
