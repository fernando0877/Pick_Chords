This Love
Maroon 5

G7                      Cm7
I was so high I didn't recognize
          Fm7                                  G7
the fire burning in her eyes, the chaos that controlled my mind...
G7                            Cm7
whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Fm7
Never to return again
                 G7
But always in my heart

 Cm  Fm       Bb        Eb
This love has taken its toll on me
 Cm          Fm      Bb           Eb
She said goodbye too many times before
    Cm  Fm       Bb          Eb
And her heart is breaking in front of me
 Cm       F           Ab              G     G7
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Cm  Fm  G7

G7                           Cm7
I tried my best to feed her appetite
                Fm7
Keep her coming every night
                    G7
So hard to keep her satisfied
G                             Cm7
Kept playing love like it was just a game
              Fm7
Pretending to feel the same
                     G7
Then turn around and leave again  (oh!)
