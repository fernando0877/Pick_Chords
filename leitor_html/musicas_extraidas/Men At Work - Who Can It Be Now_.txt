Who Can It Be Now?
Men At Work

E                        D
Who can this be, knocking at my door
C#m                 B
Go away, don't come round here no more
E                                 D
Can't you see, that it's late at night
C#m                                 B
I'm very tired, and I'm not feeling right

E                         D
All I wish, was to be alone
C#m                              B
Stay away, don't you invade my home
E                         D
Best off, if you hang outside
C#m                              B
Don't come in, I'll only run and hide

C#m
Who can it be now
B                      B         A
Who can it be now (2x) ooooohhhh ooohhhh

E                      D
Who can it be knocking at my door?
C#m                       B
Make no sound, tip-toe across the floor.
E                  D
If he hears, he'll knock all day,
C#m                             B
I'll be trapped, and here I'll have to stay

E                    D
I've done no harm, I keep to myself;
C#m                                    B
There's nothing wrong with my state of mental health.
E                   D
I like it here with my childhood friend;
C#m                     B
Here they come, those feelings again!

F#m                     B
Is this the man come to take me away
F#m                B
Why do they follow me
F#m                       B
It's not the future, that I can see
F#m                  B
It's just my fantasy
