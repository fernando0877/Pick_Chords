I can't get to sleep, I think about the implications

Of diving in too deep, And possibly the complications

Especially at night, I worry over situations

I know will be alright, Perhaps it's just imagination

Day after day it reappears
C#m                                B
  Night after night, my heartbeat, shows the fear

Ghosts appear and fade away

(Ghosts appear and fade away (2)
(Come back another day (1)

Alone between the sheets, Only brings exasperation

It's time to walk the streets, Smell the desperation

At least there's pretty lights, And though theres little variation

It nullifies the night, From overkill
