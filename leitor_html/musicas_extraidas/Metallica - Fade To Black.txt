Fade To Black
Metallica

                   Am  C  G5  Em

Am                       C
   Life, it seems, will fade away
G5                 Em
   Drifting further every day
Am                  C
   Getting lost within myself
G5                  Em
   Nothing matters, no one else
Am                  C
   I have lost the will to live
G5                Em
   Simply nothing more to give
Am                   C
   There is nothing more for me
G5                 E5
   Need the end to set me free

A5  C5  A5  D5  E5  ( C5  B5 )
A5  C5  A5  ( G5  F#5  E5 ) (2x)

 Am  C  G5  Em (2x)

Am                      C
   Things not what they used to be
G5               Em
   Missing one inside of me
Am                     C
   Deathly lost, this can't be real
G5                   Em
   Cannot stand this hell I feel
Am               C
   Emptiness is filling me
G5                Em
   To the point of agony
Am                   C
   Growing darkness taking dawn
G5               E5
   I was me, but now he's gone

A5  C5  A5  D5  E5  ( C5  B5 )
A5  C5  A5  ( G5  F#5  E5 ) (2x)

No one but me can save myself

But it's too late

Now I can't think

Think why I should even try


Yesterday seems as though

It never existed

Death greets me warm

Now I will just say goodbye
