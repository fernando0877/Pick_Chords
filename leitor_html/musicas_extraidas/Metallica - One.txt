Bm                 G7M
  I can't remember anything
Bm                        G7M     D/A
  Can't tell if this is true or dream
Bm                    A6
  Deep down inside I feel to screem
G7M                     ( E    F#  )
  This terrible silence stops me

Bm                       G7M
  Now that the war, is through with me
Bm                  G7M    D/A
  I'm waking up, I cannot see
Bm                       A6
  That there's not, much left to me
G7M                    E    F#  
  Nothing is real, but pain now

G                    D/F#
Hold my breath as I, wish for death
G                  A7        D 
         Oh please God, wake me

Bm                       G7M
  Back in the womb it's much too real
Bm                   G7M     D/A
  In pumps life that I must feel
Bm                        A6
  But can't look forward to reveal
G7M                   ( E     F#  )
  Look to the time when I'll live

Bm                            G7M
  Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Bm                     G7M  D/A
  Just like a wartime novelty
Bm                       A6
  Tied to machines that make me be
G7M                 ( E   F#  )
  Cut this life off from me

G                    D/F#
Hold my breath as I, wish for death
G                  A7        D 
         Oh please God, wake me

D  G   F  Em  (2x)

         Oh please God, help me

 E 
Darkness imprisoning me
                        ( E  F  )
All that I see, absolute horror
E 
I cannot live, I cannot die

Trapped in myself
       ( E  F  )
Body my holding cell

 E 
Land mine has taken my sight
                         ( E  F  )
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
 E 
Taken my arms, taken my legs
                           ( E  F  )
Taken my soul, left me with life in hell
