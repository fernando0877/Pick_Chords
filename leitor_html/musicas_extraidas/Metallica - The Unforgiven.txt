Am   

Am                    Em         D               Am
New blood, joins this earth  and quickly he's sub-dued.
        Am                    Em         D                      Am
Through constant pain, dis-g√£-race, the young boy, learns their rules

                          Em       D                   Am
With time, the child draws in, this whipping boy, done wrong.
                     Em           D                    Am
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man, struggles on,

                           C              G  
and on, He knows,  oooh a  vow, unto  his own 
     Am
that never from this day 
     C                 G     E7
his will they'll take away.. yeahh


Am          C               G            Em                            Am
  What I've felt, what I've known, never shined, through in, what I've shown.
      C          G          E                   Am
Never be. Never see. Won't see what might, have been

           C               G           Em                          Am
What I've felt, what I've known,never shined through in what I've shown.
       C          G        E            Am
Never free. Never me. So I dub the, unforgiven



 Am                  Em       D             Am
They dedicate their lives to running all of his
                        Em         D            Am
He tries to please them all, this bitter man he is

                         Em         D             Am
Throughout, the life the same, he's battled constantly
                      Em     D               Am
This fight he, cannot win. A tired man, they see, no longer cares

     C            G           Am
The old man then prepares, to die regret fully
      C              G   E7
That old man here is me
