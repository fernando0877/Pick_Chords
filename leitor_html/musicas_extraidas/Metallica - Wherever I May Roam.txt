           And the road Becomes my bride
                          Em
And the road, becomes my bride
                             Bb
I have stripped of all but pride
                   A
So in her I do confide
                       Bb 
And she keeps me satisfied
               
Gives me all I need

Em                            Bb
   And with dust in throat I crave
                       G 
Only knowledge will I save
                         Bb 
To the game you stay a slave

Rover, wanderer, Nomad, vagabond

Call me, what you will

( E   A   Bb   B   C  )

F                                 Em
   But I'll take my time anywhere
                               Bb 
Free to speak my mind anywhere

And I'll redefine anywhere

A                        G                   Em   A   Bb   B   C 
Anywhere I roam, Where I lay, my head is home

E                              F 
   And the Earth becomes my throne
                            Em
And the Earth becomes my throne
                   Bb 
I adapt to the unknown
                             A 
Under wandering stars I've grown
                     Bb 
By myself, but not alone
              Em 
I ask no one

                          Bb 
And my ties are severed clean
                         G 
Less I have, the more I gain
                       Bb 
Off the beaten path I reign

Rover, wanderer, Nomad, vagabond

Call me what you will,,,, And you will
