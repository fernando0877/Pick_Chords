Billie Jean
Michael Jackson

CAPO2
Em       F#m/E        G/D                  F#m/E
 She was more like, a beauty queen, from a movie scene,
Em       F#m/E                G/D          F#m/E    Am7
 I said; don't mind, but what do you mean; I am the one?
                                     Em    F#m/E  G/D
Who will dance, on the floor, in the round
          F#m/E    Am7                                      Em 
She said; I am the one, who will dance on the floor, in the round.

Em           F#m/E     G/D                 F#m/E
 She told me her name, Billie Jean, as she caused a scene.
Em          F#m/E             G/D                   F#m/E     Am7
 Then every head turned, with eyes, that dreamed of being the one,
                                     Em 
Who will dance, on the floor, in the round.

C                          Em
 People always told me; be careful what you do;
          C                                 Em
And don't go around, breaking young, girl's hearts. hhiiihh
    C                         Em
And mother always told me; be careful of who you love;
       C                                B7
And be careful of what you do, 'cos the lie, becomes the truth.

Em      F#m/E    G/D    F#m/E
 Billie Jean, is not my lover;
Em            F#m/E     G/D         F#m/E    Am7
 She's just a girl, who claims that I am the one.
                      Em  F#m/E, G/D
But the kid is not my son.
          F#m/E    Am7                          Em 
She says; I am the one, but the kiid, is not my son.

Em   F#m/E           G/D                       F#m/E
 For forty days, and forty nights, the law was on her side.
Em           F#m/E             G/D        F#m/E           Am7
 But who can stand, when she's in demand, her schemes and plans?
                                    Em    F#m/E, G/D
'Cos we danced on the floor, in the round

        F#m/E       Am7                                   Em    F#m/E
So take my strong a-dvice; just remember, to always think twice.
          G/D             F#m/E
(Do think twice, do think twice).

Em           F#m/E      G/D                          F#m/E
 She told my baby, we'd danced 'till three, then she looked a me,
Em             F#m/E     G/D             F#m/E            Am7
 Then showed a photo; my baby cried; his eyes looked like mine.
                                  Em          F#m/E  G/D  F#m/E
Go on dance, on the floor, in the round, baby

C                          Em
 People always told me; be careful what you do;
          C                                Em
And don't go around, breaking young girl's hearts.
    C                                    Em
She came and stood right by me; then the smell of sweet perfume.
     C                           B7
This happened much too soon; she called me, to her room.

Em      F#m/E    G/D    F#m/E
 Billie Jean, is not my lover;
Em            F#m/E     G/D         F#m/E    Am7
 She's just a girl, who claims that I am the one.
                      Em  F#m/E, G/D
But the kid is not my son (2x)

Em      F#m/E   G/D    F#m/E
 Billie Jean is not my lover,
Em      F#m/E   G/D    F#m/E
 Billie Jean is not my lover.
