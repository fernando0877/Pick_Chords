It's close to midnight, and something evil's, lurking in the dark.
          C#m7
Under the moonlight, you see a sight, that almost stops your heart.
           F#7                                            C#m7
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound, before you make it.
             F#7                                           C#m7
You start to freeze, as horror looks you right between the eyes;
            G#m
You're para-lyzed.
 

              C#m   E    E     F#  C#m
'Cos this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
    F#7                              F#m7
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike.
               C#m   E    E     F#  C#m
You know it's; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
       F#7                              A7      F#7         (C#m7)
You're fighting for your life, inside a killer, Thriller, to-night.
 

             C#m7                                               F#7
You hear the door slam, and realise there's nowhere left to run.
             C#m7
You feel the cold hand, and wonder if you'll ever see the sun.
               F#7                                    C#m7
You close your eyes, and hope that this is just imagi-nation.
            F#7                                         C#m7
But all the while, you hear the creature creepin' up be-hind;
              G#m
You're out of time.
 

              C#m   E    E     F#  C#m
'Cos this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
      F#7                                F#m7
There ain't no second chance to kill the thing with forty eyes, girl.
C#m    E    E     F#  C#m
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
       F#7                              A7      F#7       C#m7
You're fighting for your life, inside a killer, Thriller, to-night.

 Night creatures call and the dead start to walk in their masquerade.
C#m7                     C#m7/B                  A#m7b5
 There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien, this time;
A6                       G#7sus4  G#7
 This is the end of your life.
 

C#m7                                                             F#7
 They're out to get you; there's demons closing in on every side.
              C#m7
They will pos-sess you; unless you change the number on your dial.
           F#7                                    C#m7
Now is the time, for you and I to cuddle close to-gether.
                F#7                                         C#m7
All through the night, I'll save you from the terror on the screen;
              G#m
I'll make you see...

 Darkness falls across the land, the midnight hour is close at hand.
C#m7                A               F#sus4             F#*
 Creatures crawl in search of blood, to terrorise your neighbourhood.
C#m7                    A                  F#sus4           F#*
 And whosoever shall be found, without the soul for getting down,
     C#m7                              A       F#sus4            F#*
Must stand and face the Hounds of Hell and rot inside a corpse's shell.

           A                      F#sus4          F#*
And grizzy ghouls from every tomb, are closing in to seal your doom.

For no mere mortal can resist, the evil of The Thriller
