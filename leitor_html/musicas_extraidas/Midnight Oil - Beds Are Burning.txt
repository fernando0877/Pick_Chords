Beds Are Burning
Midnight Oil

E           
  Out where the river broke
    E7
The bloodwood and the desert oak
E4
Holden wrecks and, boiling diesels
E
Steam'in forty-five degrees

    E                 D
The time has come, to say fair's fair
   A                E
To pay the rent, to pay our share
    E                 D
The time has come, a fact's a fact
   A                      F#           E G A
It belongs to them, let's give it back

Em                         C              G    G/A
How can we dance when, our earth is turning?
Em                         C             D
How do we sleep while, our beds are burning? (2x)

Em                   C
The time has come to say fair's fair
   G                    D
To pay the rent now, to pay our share
Em                   C
The time has come, a fact's a fact
   G                            D
It belongs to them, we're gonna give it back

E
Four wheels'scare, the cockatoos
E7
From Kintore east, to Yuen-demu
    E4
The Western Desert, lives and breathes
   E
In forty-five degrees
