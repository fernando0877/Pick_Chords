Dm     F        Dm  G             Dm          Am      F   C
  Hey  hey hey  hey   There'll be food, on the table tonight
Dm     F        Dm  G             Dm          Am       F    G
  Hey  hey hey  hey   There'll be pay, in your pocket tonight

   C                          Am
My gut is wrenched out, it is crunched up and broken
   C                        Am
My life that is lived is no more than a token
       F                          G                 Am     Bdim
Who'll strike the flint up on the stone and tell me why

     C                            Am
If I yell out at night, there's a reply of blue silence
    C                      Am
The screen is no comfort I can't speak my sentence
     F                           G                     Am
They blew the lights at heaven's gate and I don't know why

Am       Dm       F          Dm       G
But if I work all day on the blue sky mine
G           Dm           Am     F     C
There'll be food on the table tonight
C       Dm          F           Dm       G
Still I walk up and down on the blue sky mine
G            Dm           Am      F    G
There'lll be pay in your pocket tonight

    C                       Am
The candy store paupers lie to the share holders
        C                           Am
They're crossing their fingers they pay the truth makers
F                     G               Am         Bdim  
 The balance sheet is breaking up the sky

       C                        Am
So I'm caught at junction still waiting for medicine
    C                         Am
The sweat of my brow keeps on feeding the engine
         F                       G                   Am
Hope the crumbs in my pocket can keep me for another night

Am         Bb              Dm            G
And if the blue sky mining company won't come to my rescue
G      Bb             Dm            G       
If the sugar refining company won't save me

F   Bb          C
    Who's gonna save me
Am              C
    Who's gonna save me
Am              C
    Who's gonna save me

C        Dm       F          Dm        G
But if I work all day on the blue sky mine
G           Dm            Am    F    C
There'll be food on the table tonight
C        Dm           F          Dm        G
And is I walk up and down on the blue sky mine
G           Dm          Am       F    C
There'll be pay in your pocket tonight

C   Dm        F             Dm      G
And some have sailed from a distant shore
G       Dm                     Am      F     C
And the company takes what the company wants
    Dm           F        Dm     G           Dm       Am    F   G
And nothing's as precious as the hole in the ground
Bb  Dm  G  Bb  Dm  G

F Bb           C
   Who's gonna save me
Am             C       Am
   Who's gonna save me
  F                   G
I pray that sense and reason
G              C
   Who's gonna save me
Am             C
   Who's gonna save me
Am                 F     G
 We got nothing to fear
C                         Am
In the end the rain comes down
C                         Am
In the end the rain comes down
F                G                       C
Washes clean the streets of the blue sky town
