Wild World
Mr Big

Dm      G7      C       F7M      Bb        Gm      A   A4(7)  A5
  Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala      

Dm              G7                 C
  Now that I've lost everything to you
            F7M                   Bb
You say you wanna start something new
     Gm                       A                  A4(7) A5
It's breaking my heart you're leaving, baby I'm grieving

Dm             G7              C
  If you wanna leave take good care
                F7M                   Bb
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
           Gm                      A       C
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

F   C                Bb
Oh, baby baby it's a wild world
C                   Bb               F    C7
   It's hard to get by, just upon a smile
F   C                 Bb
Oh, baby baby, it's a wild world
C               Bb                  F         A7
  I'll always remember you, like a child girl

Dm            G7                               C
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
         F7M                   Bb
And it's breaking my heart in two
        Gm                  A                    A4(7) A5
Cause I never wanna see you sad girl, don't be a bad  girl

Dm               G7              C
But if you wanna leave take good care
                F7M                      Bb
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
        Gm                     A        C
Just remember there's a lot of bad and beware (Refrao)

Dm      G7      C       F7M      Bb        Gm      A   A4(7)  A5
  Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala      

      A4(7) A5
Baby I love  you
Dm                 G7              C
  But if you wanna leave take good care
                F7M                     Bb
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
        Gm                     A        C
Just remember there's a lot of bad everywhere
