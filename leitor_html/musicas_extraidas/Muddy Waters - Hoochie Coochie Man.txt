   The gypsy woman told my mother, 
Before I was born
I got a boy child's coming, 
He's gonna be a son, of a gun
He gonna make pretty women's, 
Jump and shout
Then the world, wanna know

I got a black cat bone, 
I got a mojo too
I got the John the Conqueror Root, 
I'm gonna mess with you
I'm gonna make you girls, 
Lead me by my hand
Then the world will know

On the seventh hours, 
On the seventh day
On the seventh month, 
seven doctors say
He was born for good luck, that you'll see
I got seven hundred dollars

Don't you mess with me, you know I'm here
