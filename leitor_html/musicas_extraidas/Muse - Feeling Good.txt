Feeling Good
Muse

Gm         Gm/F  Eb             D
Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Gm         Gm/F  Eb           D
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Gm         Gm/F  C/E               Cm/Eb
Reeds drifting on by, you know how I feel

Dm                      Cm              Gm/Bb       D/A
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life...for me
                  Gm  Gm/F  Eb  D
And I'm feeling good

Gm         Gm/F  Eb             D
Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
Gm           Gm/F     Eb             D
River running free, you know how I feel
Gm                  Gm/F  C/E            Cm/Eb
Blossom in the trees, you know how I feel

Gm         Gm/F          Eb                D
Dragonflies out in the sun, you know what I mean, don't you know
Gm         Gm/F       Eb              D
Butterflies all having fun, you know what I mean
Gm                  Gm/F         C/E         Cm/Eb
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean

Gm             Gm/F   Eb             D
Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Gm          Gm/F    Eb            D
Said I'll be fine, you know how I feel
Gm            Gm/F  C/E           Cm/Eb
Oh freedom is mine, and I know how I feel
