Any   heart, not tough
      C        D
or strong, enough

holds a lot of rain

I'm young, I know,
    C     D
But even, so
D9/C     G         Em 
I know a thing, or two
  C            D
I learned from you

I really learned a lot,

B                 Em
really learned  a lot

 Ooo-oo Love hurts

blissful-ness, to-gether-ness
A                    A
Some fools fool, themselves, I guess
A                   D
They're not foolin' me

I know it isn't true.
  B             Em
I know it isn't true

Love is just a lie,
                 D     D9/C
made to make you blue
