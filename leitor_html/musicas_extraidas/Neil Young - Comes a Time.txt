Comes a Time
Neil Young

G Bm D Am C 
G              Bm      
   Comes a time, when your  driftin 
D                          Am         C     
  Comes a time, when, your settle down 

G              Bm 
  Comes a light, feelins liftin 
D                            Am             C               
 Lift that baby, right up, p’off the ground 

G     F        C             G 
Whoa, this old world, keeps spinnin round 
       F           C           G 
It s a wonder tall trees, aint layin down 
              Dm       G 
There comes a time

G         Bm       /
You and I, we were captured 
D             /             Am        C
 We took our souls, and we, flew away 

G              Bm        /
  We were right, we were giving 
D               /             Am           C
  That’s how we kept, what we gave away
