Harvest Moon

D D6 D7+

Em                                             D   D7+ 
 Come a little bit closer, Hear what I have to say
Em                                                        D   D7+ 
  Just like children sleepin,  We could dream this night away

G                         
  But there's a full moon risin, Let's go dancin' in the light
G
  We know where the musics playin, Lets go out and feel the night


A7/4                              A7
   Because I'm still in love with you
                         A7/4
I want to see you dance again
                               A7
Because I'm still in love with you
                D
On this harvest moon.

Em                                             D   D7+ 
  When we were strangers, I watched you from afar
Em                                              D   D7+ 
  When we were lovers, I loved you, with all my heart

G
 But now it's gettin' laaay, And the moon is climbin' high
G
  I wanna celebraaate, See it shiiinin' in your eye
