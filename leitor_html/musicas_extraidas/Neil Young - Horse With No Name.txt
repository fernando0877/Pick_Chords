Horse With No Name
Neil Young

       Em                 D   
On the first part, of the journey
      Em                 D   
I was looking at all the life
           Em                   D   
There were plants and birds, and rocks and things
           Em                 D   
There were sand and hills and rings

    Em                       D   
The first thing, I met was a fly with a buzz
        Em          D   
and the sky with no clouds
    Em                   D   
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
        Em              D   
But the air was full of sound

     Em                       D    
I've been thru the desert, on a horse with no name
        Em                    D    
It felt good to be out, of the rain
       Em                  D    
In the desert, you can't remember your name
            Em                  D    
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain  
Em        D           
la la la, la la la la la 4x

      Em              D   
After two days in the desert sun
   Em                 D   
My skin began to turn red
      Em                D   
After three days in the desert fun
      Em                 D   
I was looking at a river bed
        Em                  D   
And the story it told, of a river that flowed
        Em                  D       
Made me sad to think, it was dead (Refr√£o)

      Em                  D       
After nine days I let the horse run free
          Em         D   
Cause the desert had turned to sea
           Em                   D   
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
           Em                 D   
There were sand and hills and rings

    Em                         D   
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
        Em               D   
And the perfect disguise above
          Em            D   
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
        Em                  D   
But the humans will give no love
