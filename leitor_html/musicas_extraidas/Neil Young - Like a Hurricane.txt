Like a Hurricane
Neil Young

Am  G  F  Em  G
Am                              G
Once I thought I saw you in a crowded hazy bar
F                                     Em  G
Dancing on the light from star to star

Am                         G
Far across the moonbeam I know that's who you are
   F                                      Em  G
I saw your brown eyes turning once to fire

C      G    F        G       C        G   F       G
   You are like a hurricane, there's calm in your eye
C    G   F            G
And I'm getting blown away
F
There's somewhere safer where the feelings stay
I wanna love you but I'm getting blown away

Am                       G
I am just a dreamer, but you are just a dream
         F                          Em  G
And you could have been anyone to me

Am
Before that moment you touched my lips
     G
That perfect feeling when time just slips 
  F                                Em  G
Away between us and our foggy trips

Am                         G
You are just a dreamer and I am just a dream
F                               Em G
You could have been anyone to me

Am
Before that moment you touched my lips
     G
That perfect feeling when time just slips 
  F                                 Em  G
Away between us and our foggy trips
