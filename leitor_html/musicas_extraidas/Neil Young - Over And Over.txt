Over And Over
Neil Young

G                  C                     D
 At night when the sky is clear, and the moon is shining down
G              C               D
 My heart goes running back to you
G              C            D
  I looove the way you open up and let me in
G        C               D                   G
 So I go running back to you, Over and over again.

G        C             D
Over and over again my love
G        C               D
Over and over again with you (2x)
C D (4x)

G            C                       D
Remember the nights of love and that moment on the beach
G           C                D
That wasn't really too long ago
G               C                  D
But we paid the price of time, and now it's out of reach
G          C              D                   G
And so the broken circle goes, Over and over again.

G              C                 D
Somewhere in a fire of love, our dreams went up in smoke
G            C             D
We danced beneath silver rain
G         C                     D
Upon the fields of green, where time was just a joke
G           C                   D                   G
And now the feeling's just the same, Over and over again
