Rockin' In The Free World
Neil Young

Em7                D  C      Em7           D  C
Colours on the street... Red white and blue
       Em7               D  C         Em7              D  C
People shufflin their feet... People sleepin in their shoes

              Em                   D     C
But there's a warnin' sign on, the road ahead
          Em                            D          C
There's a lot of people sayin', we'd be better off dead
      Em                   D        C
Don't feel like Satan, but I'm to them
     Em                   D     C
so I try to forget it, anyway I can


G           D                  C     Em
   Keep on rockin'in the free world    (3x)
G           D                  C     Em  A5
   Keep on rockin'in the free world


         Em7             D  C        Em7               D  C
I see a woman in the night... With a baby in her hand
         Em7             D  C        Em7            D  C
Under an old street light... Near a garbage can

         Em                          D             C
Now she puts the kid away, And she's gone to get a hit
    Em                             D       C
She hates her life and, what she's done to it
           Em                        D         C
That's one more kid that will, never go to school
      Em                         D          C
Never get to fall in love, never get, to be cool (Refrão)

We got a thousand points of light... For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler... Machine gun hand

         Em                    D      C
We got depar-tment stores, and toilet paper
        Em                        D    C 
we Got styro-foam boxes, for the ozone layer
         Em                           D     C
we Got a man of the people says, keep hope alive
       Em                   D        C
we Got fuel to burn, we got roads to drive (Refrão)
