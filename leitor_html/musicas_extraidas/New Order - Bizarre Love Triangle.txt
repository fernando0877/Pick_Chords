C               D
  Every time I, think of you
      Bm                          C
I get shot, right through, with a bolt of blue
                                    D
It's no problem of mine, but it's a problem I find
Bm                    C
Living a life, that I can't leave behind

C                     D
 There's no sense, in telling me
    Bm                      C
The wisdom of a fool, won't set you free
               C
But that's the way, that it goes
               D
And it's what, nobody knows
      Bm            C               C   D   Bm   C
While every day, my confusion grows

C             D
Every time I, see you falling
Bm                 C
I  get down on my, knees and pray
    C                 D
I'm waiting for, that final moment
Bm                          C          D C D Bm
You'll, say the words, that I can't say      

C                  D
  I feel fine, and I feel good
      Bm              C
  I'm feeling like I, never should
         C                            D
Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
             Bm                     C
Why can't we be, ourselves, like we were yesterday

C                   D
 I'm not sure what, this could mean
Bm                     C
 I don't think you're, what you seem,
                                D
I do admit to myself, That if I hurt someone else
          Bm                   C
Then I'll never see, just what we're, meant to be
