F
Maybe I've forgotten
    Bb
The name and the address
   F
Of everyone I've ever known
     Bb
It's nothing I regret
Dm           Am
Save it for another day
         Bb
It's the school exam
                   C
The kids have run away

Am7
I would like a place I can call my own
C
Have a conversation on my telephone
Am7
Wake up everyday, that would be a start
C
I would not complain with my wounded heart

F       Am
I was upset, you see
F               C
Almost all the time
F            Am
You used to be a stranger
F            C
Now you are mine

  F
I wouldn't even trust you
     Bb
I've not that much to give
      F
We're dealing in the limits, and
Bb
We don't know who with
Dm                     Am
You may think that I'm out of hand
     Bb
That I'm naive, I'll understand
   C              Am
On this occasion, it's not true
Bb                      C
Look at me, I'm not you

 Am7
I would like a place I can call my own
C
Have a conversation on the telephone
Am7
Wake up everyday, that would be a start
C
I would not complain with my wounded heart

F        Am
I was a short fuse
F               C
Burning all the time
F        Am
You were a complete stranger
F               C
Now you are mine

F  Bb  F  Bb
        Dm  Am  Bb  C

Am7
I would like a place I can call my own
C
Have a conversation on the telephone
Am7
Wake up everyday, that would be a start
C
I would not complain with my wounded heart
F               C
Just wait 'till tomorrow
                         F
I guess that's what they all say
        C
Just before they fall apart

( F  Am  F  C )
