Feed the machine
Nickelback

Cm                           
Addressing those beneath from high above
Cm                       
Convincing his belief for what you love
Cm
Baiting every hook with filthy lies
Cm 
Another charlatan to idolize

Cm                               Fm
  Is this suppression just in my mind? (just in my mind?)
Cm                               Fm
  No more questions, get back in line! (just get back in line!)

[Cmhorus]
                  Cm
You pay with your life
               G#                   Fm
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (the longer it takes)
                  Cm
But now it's your turn
               G#               Fm
The ashes will burn, and wither away
             Cm                G#                   Fm
Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)
                Cm                       G#              Fm
And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (to feed the machine)

[Verse 2]
Cm                               
The gears forever turn to grind the mice
Cm                              
Will you become the fuel for sacrifice?
Cm
Power absolutely all for show
Cm
The piper blows his flute and off you go

Cm                               Fm
  Is this obsession behind your eyes? (behind your eyes?)
Cm                              Fm
 No more questions, get back in line! (just get back in line!)

[Chorus]
                  Cm
You pay with your life
    A#         G#                   Fm
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (the longer it takes)
                  Cm
But now it's your turn
               G#               Fm
The ashes will burn, and wither away
             Cm                G#                   Fm
Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)
                Cm                       G#              Fm
And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (to feed the machine)

Cm            A#          Gm       Fm
Why must the blind always lead the blind?

Why do I feel like the fault is mine?
