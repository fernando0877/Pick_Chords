(Gaita em A)

E   G
I   need an, easy friend

I do, With an, ear to lend

I do, Think you, fit this shoe

I do, But DO, you have a clue?



C#m    G#      F#
  I'll take, advantage while
C#m    G#      F#
   You hang me,  out to dry
    E       A        C              E    G
But I can't see you, every night... Free, ...I do


I'm standing in your line

I do, Hope you have the time

I do, Pick up number two

I do, Keep a date with you
