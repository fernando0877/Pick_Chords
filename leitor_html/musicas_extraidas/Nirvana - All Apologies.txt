What else do I be, all apologies,
what else could I say, everyone is gay

What else could I write, I don't have the right,
what else should I be, all apologies

F
  In the sun, in the suuun, I feel as one,
                           G
in the sun, in the suuuun, married, buried

C
I wish I was like you, easily amused,
find my nest of salt, everything's, my fault
C
I'll take ,a ll the blame, all perceived, from shame,
sunburnt freezer burn, choking on, the ashes of her enemies

F
  In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one,
                         G
in the sun, in the sun, married, buried
