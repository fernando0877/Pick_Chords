  She should’ve stayed, away from friends

  She should’ve had, more time to spend

  She should’ve died, when she was born

  She should’ve worn, the crown of  thorns


D             G  F      E
She should’ve,   been a son (4x)



D                  D               D
  She should’ve stood, out in a    crowd

  She should’ve made, her mother    proud

  She should’ve fallen, on her  stance

  She should’ve had, another    chance
