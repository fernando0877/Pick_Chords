Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Nirvana

D            C             G        Cadd9 G
Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
D            C               G   Cadd9 G
Sunbeams are never made like me

D                  C
Don't expect me to cry,
            G                     Cadd9  G
For all the reasons you had to die
D          C                G   Cadd9  G
Don't ever ask your love of me

D                  C
Don't expect me to cry
D                  C
Don't expect me to lie
D                  C       G   Cadd9  G
Don't expect me to die for thee
