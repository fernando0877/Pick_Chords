Polly
Nirvana

Em G               D      C
     Polly wants a cracker
Em G                    D      C
   I think I should get off her first
Em G          D            C
   Think she wants some water
Em G           D      C
   To put out the blow torch

D    C        G   Bb
     Isn't me,    Have a seed
     Let me clip, Dirty wings
     Let me take a ride, Cut yourself
     Want some my help, Please myself

D    C            G   Bb
     Got some rope,   Have been told
     Promise you, Have been true
     Let me take a ride, Cut yourself
     Want some my help, Please myself

Em G      D           C
   Polly wants a cracker
Em G        D            C
   Maybe she would like some food
Em G          D         C
   She ask me to untie her
Em G              D       C
   A chase would be nice for a few, ..Chorus

Em G           D        C
   Polly says her back hurts
Em G          D        C
   She's just as bored as me
Em G          D      C
   She caught me off my guard
Em G      D              C
   Amazes me, the will  of instinct
