Son of gun
Nirvana

A       E            D               E
Up, up, up and down, turn, turn, turnaround,
A             E              D    E
round, round, roundabout and over again.
A         E             D           E
Gun, gun, son of a gun, you are the only one,
A              E             D      E
that makes any difference, to what I say.

Sun shines, in the bedroom,    when we play,
G           C              D            C 
the raining, always starts, when you go away
