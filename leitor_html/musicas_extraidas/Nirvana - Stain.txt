Well, he never  bleeds, and he never  fucks,
D   D#     E         D     D#       E 
And he never leaves, 'cause he's got, bad luck
D   D#       E       D  D#       E 
Well he never reads, and he never  draws,
D   D#      E         D     D#       E 
And he never sleeps, 'cause he's got, bad blood, yeah
