Territorial Pissing
Nirvana

A      F      D
When I was an alien
A        F        D
Cultures weren't opinions


A                   F            D
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there
A                   F              D
Gotta find a way, a better way, I had better wait

A     F      D
Never met a wise man
A     F      D
If so it's a woman

refr√£o:


| A    | A    | A    | A    | (x2)



A      F            D
Just because you're paranoid
A          F           D
Don't mean they're not after you
