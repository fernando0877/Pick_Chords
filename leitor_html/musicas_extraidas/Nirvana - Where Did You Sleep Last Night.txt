Where Did You Sleep Last Night
Nirvana


E                       A       G
My girl, my girl, don't lie, to me
        B                          E 
Tell me where, did you sleep, last night?
        E   
In the pines, in the pines, 
           A              G
where the sun, don't ever shine
         B                       E 
I would shiver, the whole, night through


   E                    A         G
My girl, my girl, where will, you go?
    B                           E 
I'm going, where the cold, wind blows
       E   
In the pines, in the pines, 
          A               G 
where the sun, don't ever shine
        B                        E 
I would shiver, the whole, night through


    E                     A         G
Her hus, band was, a hard wooorking man
       B                 E 
Just about, a mile, from here
    E                     A       G
His head, was found, in a driving wheel
        B                  E 
But his body, neeever, was found
