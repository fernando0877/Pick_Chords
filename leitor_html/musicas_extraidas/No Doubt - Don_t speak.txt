Don't speak
No Doubt

Bm            F#m          Em
You and me we used to be together
A           F#m      Em    A
Every day together, always
  Bm       F#m         Em         A
I really feel that I'm losing my best friend
  F#m                 Bm       Em     A
I can't believe this could be the end
   Bm         F#m    Em           A
It looks as though you're letting go
    D                  A               B
And if it's real, well I don't want to know

-------
Em           Am                    D
Don't speak, I know just what you're saying
B                Am
So please stop explaining
      B                 Em      Am  B
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

Em           Am                  D
Don't speak, I know what you're thinking
B                  Am
I don't need your reasons,
      B                 Em      Am  D
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

    Bm       F#m           Em
Our memories they can be inviting
             A          F#m      Em        A
But some are altogether mighty frightening
Bm   F#m   Em          A
As we die, both you and I
D                     A              B
  With my head in my hands I sit and cry

refrão:
C        G/B
It's all ending
        Bb      F/A            Ab A D    A D G
I gotta stop pretending who we are...

Bm        F#m  Em           A          Em  A
You and me,    I can see us dying... are we?
refrão:

      Am       B        Em
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts!
