tom orig Bm

Bm             F#m           Em
You and me, we used to be, together
A           F#m      Em    A
Every day together, always
  Bm       F#m         Em         A
I really feel that I'm losing my best friend
  F#m                 Bm       Em     A
I can't believe this could be the end

   Bm         F#m    Em           A
It looks as though you're, letting go
    D                  A               B
And if it's real, well I don't want to know

Em             Am                    D
Don't speak, I know just what you're saying
B                Am              B                 Em      Am  B
So please stop explaining, Don't tell me, cause it hurts

Em             Am                  D
Don't speak, I know what you're thinking
B                  Am            B                 Em      Am  D
I don't need your reasons, Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

    Bm       F#m           Em
Our memories they can be inviting
             A          F#m      Em        A
But some are altogether mighty frightening
Bm   F#m   Em          A
As we die, both you and I
D                     A              B
  With my head in my hands I sit and cry

Chorus:

Em
C        G/B
It's all ending
        Bb      F/A            Ab5 A5 D5    A5 D5 G5
I gotta stop pretending who we are...
