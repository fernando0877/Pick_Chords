Ever fallen in love with someone
Nouvelle Vague

    Dm
You spurn my natural emotions
You make me feel like di-i-i-rt
    F
And I'm, hurt
    Dm
And if I start a commotion
I run the risk of losing you
    F
And that's, worse

Dm                   C                          Dm
Fallen in love, with someone, in Ever fallen in love
             C                          Eb
In love with someone, in Ever fallen in love
               Bb                                C
In love with someone, You shouldn't've fallen in love with (2x)

  Dm
I can't see much of a future
                                    F
Unless we find out what's to blame, what
  /
A shame
    Dm
And we can't be together
Until we realize that we are 
F
  the same (Chorus (x2)
