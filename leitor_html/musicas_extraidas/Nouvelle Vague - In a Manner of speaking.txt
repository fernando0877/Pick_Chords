In a Manner of speaking
Nouvelle Vague

Capo on 6th
Am C F E E7
Am
In a Manner of speaking
               C
I just want to say
                          F
That I could never forget the way
You told me everything
   E                E7
By saying nothing

Am
In a manner of speaking
             C
I don't understand
                                 F
How love in silence becomes reprimand
But the way that i feel about you
E               E7
Is beyond words

Am             C
Oh give me the words
            F  
Give me the words
E            E7
That tell me nothing
Am               C  
Ohohohoh give me the words
        F
Give me the words
     E       E7     
That tell me everything

Am
In a manner of speaking
                C
Semantics won't do
                                       F
In this life that we live we only make do
And the way that we feel
               E     E7
Might have to be sacrificed

Am
So in a manner of speaking
                C
I just want to say
                                   F
That just like you I should find a way
To tell you everything
     E              E7
By saying nothing.
