Just can't get enough (Depeche Mode)
Nouvelle Vague

Capo 4, to B, forma A

G                          /
When I'm with you baby, I go out, of my head,
      C
and I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough.

G                                /
All the things you do to me, and everything you said,
      C
and I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough.

D                        Em
We slip and slide as, we fall in love,
       C                  D
And I just can't seem, to get enough of
tchu tchu tchu tttt..

G                        /
We walk together, when I walking down the street,
      C     
and I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough.
G                            /
Every time I think of you, I know we have to meet,
      C                            
and I just can't get enough, and I just can't get enough.

D                           Em
It's getting harder, it's a burning love,
       C                  D
And I just can't seem, to get enough of
tchu tchu tchu tttt..

G                         /
  When, it rains, you're shining down for me,
       C
and I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough,
G                            /
  Just, like a rainbow, you know you set me free,
       C
and I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough,

D                             Em
You're like an angel, and you give me your love,
       C                  D
And I just can't seem, to get enough of
tchu tchu tchu tttt..
