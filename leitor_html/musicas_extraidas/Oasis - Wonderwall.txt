Em           G
   Today is gonna be the day
              D                      A
That they're gonna throw it back to you
Em              G
   By now you should've somehow
    D                    A
Realized what you gotta do
Em                   G
I don't believe that anybody
D               A            C  D  A
Feels the way I do about you now


Em                G
   Backbeat, the word was on the street
          D                    A
That the fire in your heart is out
Em                  G
   I'm sure you've heard it all before
         D                  A
But you never really had a doubt
Em                   G
I don't believe that anybody
D               A            C  D  A
Feels the way I do about you now


    C                 D                Em
And all the roads, We have to walk are winding
    C                 D                Em
And all the lights, That lead us there are blinding
  C              D                  G              Em
There are many things that I, Would like to say to you
                  A
But I don't know how


         C    Em  G       Em
Because maybe,     You're gonna be the one
      C       Em  G     Em      C Em G
That saves me      And after all
           Em    C   Em  G  Em  A
You're my wonderwall
