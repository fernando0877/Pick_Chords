Valentina
Off The Wall

Am          F               G7    //
 Out of the neon shining bright   
Out came a dancer shining bright
She moves like a whispers after night
Caught in between the spelling night
       Am  F G7   
Valentina,       
                Am  F G7
sweet flower of Mexico
Growing in the wild places 
Where only the wild ones go (yeah, She walk)

Out of the sun and climbing high
She came on like fire right into my side
Burning with promise hot and dry
Caught in between the spelling night

She walkin down at the streets
This guy nutry dress
She is out of the zero Porto Rico'n boys
And she`s  forget tonight, hey

Am    F     G7          
  Walk Valentina, Keep On Keep On
Walk Valentina, and she this Keep some walking
Walk Valentina, heeeey heeey Valentina
Walk Valentina, sweet flower of Mexico
Walk Valentina, Growing in the wild places
Walk Valentina, Where only the wild ones go
