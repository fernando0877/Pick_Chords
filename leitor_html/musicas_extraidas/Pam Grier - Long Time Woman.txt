Long Time Woman
Pam Grier

Em
I'm a long time woman
And i'm serving my time
                       A
I've been lock away so long now
I forgot my crime

Then working on the road now,
I've been working by the sea
? Working?
And i wanna be free

Well ninety nine years, is a long long long time
Ninety nine years, is such a long long long time
Ninety nine years, is a long long time
Well look at me, i'll never be free

I'm a long time woman
Ain't nobody to please
Got a natural feelings
Like a bad disease

Well ninety nine years is a long long time
Well ninety nine, ninety nine years, is such a long long time
Well ninety nine years is a long long time
Well look at me, i'll never be free

I'm a long time woman
Hmm, hmm, hmm .
Doo, doo, doo, doo...
