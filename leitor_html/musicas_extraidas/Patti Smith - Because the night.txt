Because the night
Patti Smith

Bm      G          A         Bm
Take me now, baby, here as I am.
        G              A    Bm
Pull me close, try and understand.
          G              A      Bm
Desire is hunger, is the fire I breathe.
          G           A        Bm
Love is a banquet, on which we feed.

G       A            D      A
Come on now, try and understand
    Bm    G              /        A
the way I feel, when I'm in your hand.
D       G          /     A
Take my hand; come under cover.
     C
They can't hurt you now,
Bm                  F#
can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now.

Bm          G       /        A     Bm
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Bm          G       /        A     Bm
Because the night belongs to lust.
Bm          G       /        A     Bm
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Bm          G       /        A     Bm
Because the night belongs to us.

Bm     G      A         Bm
Have I doubt, when I'm alone?
          G         A   Bm
Love is a ring, the telephone.
           G         A         Bm
Love is an angel, disguised as lust,
            G              A       Bm
here in our bed, until the morning comes.

G       A            D    A
Come on now, try and understand
    Bm    G          /        A
the way I feel, under your command.
D       G           /       A
Take my hand, as the sun descends.
     C
They can't touch you now,
Bm                   F#
can't touch you now, can't touch you now.
