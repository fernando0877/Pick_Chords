E               A9                E              A9   
Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
     E                 A               E
Were laid spread out before me, as her body once did

E              A9                  E                      A9   
ohh All five horizons revo-oolved, around her soul, as the earth to the sun
E             A                          E            A9
Now the air I tasted and breathed, ha-as taken a turn

C                                      Em
 Hmmmm, and all I taught her was, everything
C                                     Em
 Hmmmm, I know she, gave me all, that she wore

           D                     C                    C             Em
And now my bitter hands, Chafe beneath the clouds, Of what was everything
        D                       C                C             Em
All the pictures have, All been washed in black, Tattooed everything

E          A9                   E               A9   
  I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by, some kids at play
E                  A              E
  I can feel their laughteeer, so why do I sear

C                                              Em
 Hmmmm, and twisted thoughts that spin, 'round my head, I'm spinning, oh
      C                                     Em
 I'm spinning, how quick the sun can, drop awaaaaaaay

           D                    C                 C            Em
And now my bitter hands, Cradle broken glass, Of what was everything
        D                       C                C             Em
All the pictures have, All been washed in black, Tattooed everything
        D                        C
All the love gone bad, Turned my world to black
                  D                C              Em
And tattooed aaall I see, All that I am, All I'll beeeeeeee
