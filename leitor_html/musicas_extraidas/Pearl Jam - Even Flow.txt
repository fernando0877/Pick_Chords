Fre--ezin', rests his head, on a pillow, made of concrete, again
Oh, Fee--lin' maybe he'll see, a little better, set a days,   ooh yeah
Oh, hand out, faces that he sees, time again, ain't that familiar,  ooh

Oh, pra--yin', now to something that has, never showed, him anything
Oh, fee--lin', understands the weather, of the winters, on its way
Oh, cei--lings, few and far between, all the legal, halls of shame,

Oh, someday yet, he'll begin his life again
    D          Bb                            D  C  
Oh, whispering hands, gently lead, lead him away

him a--way, him a--way
