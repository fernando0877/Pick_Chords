Jeremy
Pearl Jam

50, 55, 57, 50, 
A    G            A
  At home drawing pictures, Of mountain tops
With him on top, Lemon yellow sun,

Arms raised in V, Dead lay 
in pools, of maroon below

Daddy, didn't give, attention Oh, 
To the fact that, mommy didn't care

G/B              A          G/B
King Jeremy, the wicked, Oh ruled his world
F              G         A
Jeremy spoke in, class today

Clearly I remember, Picking on the boy
Seemed a harmless, little fuck,

Uhoommm we unleashed, the lion
Ganash teeth bit the recessed ladys breast
Hoooow, could I forget

And he hit me, with a surprise left
My jaw left hurting, ohh jaw at open, Just like the day
Oooooh like the day, I heeeard

Daddy, didn't give affection, nooo
And the boy, was something, 
that mommy, wouldn't wear

G/B              A          G/B
King Jeremy, the wicked, Oh ruled his world
F              G         A
Jeremy spoke in, class today


Try to forget this, Tryyy to erase this (2x)
              F  G  A  /   /  /  /  /
From the blackboooooooard, uoohhh
