You were always on my mind (elvis)
Pet you boys

G                  D
Maybe I didn't treat you
Em       D         C
Quite as good as I should
G              D
Maybe I didn't love you
Em       D          A7
Quite as often as I could   

C                          G
  Little things I shoul’ve said and done
C   /B             Am
  I never took the time

D7                      G
  You were always on my mind        
C          D            Bb   C
  You were always on my mind        

(melodia inicial)
G              D
Maybe I didn't hold you
Em        D              C
All those lonely, lonely times   
G                   D
And I guess I never told you
Em     D                 A7
I'm so happy that you're mine

C                   G
 If I made you feel second best
C     /B          Am
  I'm sorry I was blind
