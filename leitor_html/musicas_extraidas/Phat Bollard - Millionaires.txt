Millionaires
Phat Bollard

I don't give to the big issue seller 
Cause he's probably on heroin 
I walk past him with a grin 
and if I can I kick his dog

No, I don't give to the busker
He's talentless and lazy
He's ruining the country
I think he should get a job

Instead, I give my money to
Walmart for its tax evasion
Primark for its child labor
Texaco for the next invasion
I don't give a fuck about you

I give my money to the millionaires (x2) 
I give all my money to the millionaires 
and I don't give a fuck about you

No, I don't give to the beggar
That's what I pay my taxes for 
The government should shove him through the door, 
of a prison cell or a hospital 

I don't give to the homeless pisshead
He'll blow it all on booze instead 
Such a waster, doesn't deserve a bed
What do you mean? Welfare is dead

Because I give my money to:
Walmart for its tax evasion
Primark for its child labor
Texaco for the next invasion
Don't give a fuck about you

I give my money to the millionaires (x2) 
I give all my money to the millionaires 
that don't give a fuck about you

I give my money to Starbucks 
in case they get hard up
BP cause making a living aint easy
Barclays cause they look after me 
and I don't give a fuck about you 

I give my money to the millionaires (x2) 
I give all my money to the millionaires 
and I don't give a fuck about you
