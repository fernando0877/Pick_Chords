Take a Look At Me Now
Phil Collins

Dm  G  Dm  G
(voz T)
Am                     Bm
How can I just let you walk away, 
             C               Dm
just let you leave without a trace
         F           G/F              Em    Am
When I stand taking every breath with you, ooh
           Dm                             G4  G
You're the only one, who really knew me at all

Am                     Bm
How can you just walk away from me,
         C                     Dm
when all I can do is watch you leave
           F                  G/F  
Cos we've shared the laughter and the pain
         Em          Am
and even shared the tears
           Dm                              G
You're the only one, who really knew me at all

                     C/G                       D/C
So take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
                    Am                    F
And there's nothing left here to remind me,
         Dm             G
just the memory of your face

                      C/G                        D/
Now take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
               Am             F                   
And you coming back to me is against the odds 
           Dm               G4   G
and that's what I've got to face

  Am                         Bm
I wish I could just make you turn around,
C                      Dm
turn around and see me cry
           F              G/F
There's so much I need to say to you,
   Em           Am
so many reasons why
           Dm                              G
You're the only one, who really knew me at all

refrao
          Dm                G4   G
It's the chance I've gotta take
                  C/G
Take a look at me now
