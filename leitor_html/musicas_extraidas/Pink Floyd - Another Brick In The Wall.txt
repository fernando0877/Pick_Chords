Another Brick In The Wall
Pink Floyd

D   C   Bb   A  Gm
A    /
When we grew up, and went to school

There were certain teachers 
who would Hurt the children
   C            Am
in any way they could

   Am
By pouring their derision
     F
Upon anything we did
  Am
exposing every weakness
  F               /
However carefully hidden
       Am
by the kids

           Dm                /
But in the town, it was well known
              Bb
When they got home at night,
      /           Gm
their fat, Psycho-Pathic wives 
would thrash them
C                            (F    Bb) (3x) C
Within inches of their lives, oooo oooo

Dm
We don't need no, education

We dont need no, thought control

No dark sarcasm, in the classroom

Teachers leave them, kids alone


G                                   Dm  Dm C Dm C G F
    Hey Teachers, Leave, them kids alone
F                      C                      Dm
  All in all it's just, another brick in the wall
F                       C                      Dm
  All in all you're just, another brick in the wall
