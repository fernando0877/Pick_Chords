Em9                          A   Em9                    A
   Breathe... breathe in the air,   Don't be afraid, to care
Em9                   A     
   Leave... but don't leave me,
Em9                                 A
   Look around and choose, your own ground

    C7+
For long you live, and high you fly
     Bm7
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
    F7+
And all you touch and all you see
   G7+                D7(#9)  D7(b9)
Is all your life will ever     be

Em9               A   Em9                          A
  Run, run rabbit run,   Dig that hole, forget the sun,
Em9                              A
   And when at last, the work is done
Em9                                  A
   Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one

    C7+
For long you live, and high you fly
    Bm7
But only if you, ride the tide
     F7+
And balanced on, the biggest wave
    G7+              D7(#9)   D7(b9)    Em9
You race toward and, early   grave
