Bm
Money, get away
D
Get a good, job with, more pay and your OK

Money It's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
 F#m                    Fm   Em
New car, caviar, four stars daydream
  Em                           Bm
Think I'll buy me a footbaaall team

Money, get back
I'm all right Jack keep your hands of my stack
Money It's a hit
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
            F#m               Fm   Em
I'm in the hi fidelity fist class travelling se
Em                           Bm
And I think, I need, a Lear jet

Money, It's a crime
Share It fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money so they say
Is the root of all evil today

 F#m                                         Fm  Em
But if you ask for a rise It's no surprise that they're
 Em           Bm
Giving none away
