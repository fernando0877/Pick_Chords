Time
Pink Floyd

 F#m                                     A 
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
       E                                         F#m
You fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way
 F#m                                         A
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
 E                                                F#m
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

 D7+
Tired of lying in the sunshine
 A7+
Staying home to watch the rain
 D7+
You are young and life is long
A7+
And there is time to kill today
D7+
And then one day you find
 C#m7
Ten years have got behind you
 Bm7
No one told you when to run
                        E
You missed the starting gun

(Solo) F#m  A  E  F#m  F#m  A  E  F#m

F#m                                               A   
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
 E                                         F#m  
And racing around to come up behind you again
   F#m                                            A       
The sun is the same in the relative way, but you're older
 E                                             F#m
And shorter of breath and one day closer to death

D7+
Every year is getting shorter
 A7+
Never seem to find the time
  D7+
Plans that either come to naught
A7+
Or half a page of scribbed lines
 D7+
Hanging on a quiet desperation
C#m7
Is the english way
  Bm7
The time is gone, the song is over
  B7(#9)                   B7(b9)
Thought i'd something more to say
Em9  A7

Em9           A7     A7/4   A7
  Home, Home again
Em9                           A7
  I'd like to be here when I can
Em9                          A7
  When I come home cold and tired
Em9                                      A7
  It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
 C7+/G
Far away, across the field,
  Bm7
The tolling of the iron bell
 F7+/C
Call the faithful to their knees,
 G6/D               D7(#9) D7(b9)    Bm
To hear the softly spoken magic spells
