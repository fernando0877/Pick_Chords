C                           D/F#
  So, so you think you can tell
             Am/E                  G
Heaven from hell, blue skies from pain

                      D/F#
Can you tell a green field
                   C                    Am/E
From a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil?
                      G
Do you think you can tell?

                      C                      D/F#
Did they get you to trade, your heroes for ghosts
                Am/E
Hot ashes for trees
               G        
Hot air for a cool breeze, 

                 D/F#              C
cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
                       Am/E                      G
A walk on part in the war, for a lead role in a cage?
(solo)

C                                  D/F#
  How I wish, how I wish you were here
             Am/E
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
G
  Year after year

D/F#
     Running over the same old ground
C                                   Am/E
  What have we found? The same old fears
               G
Wish you were here
