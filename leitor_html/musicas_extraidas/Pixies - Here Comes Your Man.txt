Here Comes Your Man
Pixies


D   D  G  A7

D                   A7
  Outside there's a box car waiting
Em            G   
  Outside the family stew
D            A7
  Out by the fire breathing
Em            G   
  Outside we wait, until face turns blue

D            A7
 I know the nervous walking
Em            G   
  I know the dirty beard haaangs
D                 A7
   Out by the box car waiting
Em                 G   
   Take me away to nowhere plains


Bm                 G     A7                   D
There is a wait so long, You'll never wait so long
D  G  A7               D
      Here comes your man


D                 A7
Big shake on the box car moving
Em            G   
Big shake to the land that's falling down
D                 A7
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
Em            G   
A big big stone fall and break my crown
