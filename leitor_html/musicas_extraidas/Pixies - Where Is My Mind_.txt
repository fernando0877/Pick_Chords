Where Is My Mind?
Pixies

With your feet on the air 
and your head on the ground,
Try this trick and spin it, yeah,

Your head will collapse 
but theres nothing in it,
And youll ask yourself

Where is my mind? Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, See it swimming?

I was swimming in the Caribbean,
Animals were hiding behind the rocks,

Except the little fish,
But they told me this is where 
its gonna talk to me honey bunny
