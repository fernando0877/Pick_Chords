Kiss
Prince

                     A7
You don’t have to be beautiful, to turn me on
                  A7
I just need, your body baby, from dusk, till dawn
                    D7
You don’t, need, experience, to turn me out
                   A7
You just leave, it all up to me
A7
  I’m gonna show you, what it’s all about

                     E7
You don’t have to be rich, to be my girl
                     D7
You don’t have to be cool, to rule my world
                    E7
Ain’t no particular sign I’m more compatible with
                 D7
I just want your extra time, and your..... kiss

                     A7
You don’t have to be dirty baby, if you wanna impress me
                 A7
You can’t be too flirty mama, I know how to undress me
                  D7
I want to be your fantasy, maybe you could be mine
                      A7
You just leave it all up to me, we could have a good time

refrão:

           A7
Women, not girls, rule my world, I said they rule my world
         A7
Act your age, not your shoe size, maybe we could do the twirl
                        D7
You don’t have to watch Dynasty, to have an attitude
                      A7
You just leave it all up to me, my love will be your food
