Whiter Shade Of Pale
Proco Harum

C     C/B              /A     /G
We skipped the light fandango
F    F/E                     /D    /C
turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
G       G/F          Em      Em/D
I was feeling kinda seasick
C        C/B           Am         Am/G
but the crowd called out for more
F       F/E          Dm     Dm/C
The room was humming harder
G       G/F          Em    Em/D
as the ceiling flew away
C          C/B            Am     Am/G
When we called out for another drink
F       F/E          Dm
the waiter brought a tray

G7          C  C/B        Am    Am/G
And so it was,___ that later,____
F       F/E             Dm  Dm/C
as the miller told his tale
G   G/F                  Em           Em/D
that her face, at first just ghostly,
           C    F        C    G6add11 G6
turned a whiter shade of pale
C C/B  Am Am/G  F F/E  Dm Dm/C  G G/F  Em Em/D  C F  G F G

C     C/B            Am     Am/G
She said there is no reason
F        F/E              Dm    Dm/C
And the truth is plain to see
G       G/F                Em       Em/D
But I wandered through my playing cards
C       C/B       Am       Am/G
Would not let her be
F       F/E           Dm      Dm/C
One of sixteen vestal virgins
G        G/F             Em    Em/D
Who were leaving for the coast
C           C/B           Am   Am/G
And although my eyes were o____pen
F       F/E                  Dm
They might just as well been closed

G7          C  C/B        Am    Am/G
And so it was,___ that later,____
F       F/E             Dm  Dm/C
as the miller told his tale
G   G/F                  Em           Em/D
that her face, at first just ghostly,
           C    F        C    G6add11 G6
turned a whiter shade of pale

C C/B  Am Am/G  F F/E  Dm Dm/C  G G/F  Em Em/D  C F  G
