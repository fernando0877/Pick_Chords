Another on bites the dust
Queen

E G E A
Steve walks warily down the street
With his brim pulled way down low
Ain´t no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go

             C          G
Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this
             C                     G
Are you hanging on the edge of you seat
C                      G
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
A                  B              E
To the sound of the beat, yeah

E G            E         A
Another on bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one goes,and another one gone
Another one bites the dust

F#            A
Hey,I´m gonna get you too
F#                    B    (E G E A)
Another one bites the dust

Em
How do you think I´m going to get alone
Am
Without you when you are gone
Em
You took me for everything that I had
Am
And kicked me out on my own

            C          G
Are you happy, are you sastisfied
       C                   G
How long can you stand the heat
C                      G
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
A                   B
To the sound of the beat
Refrão

There are plenty of ways, you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him bad and
You can treat him bad and
leave him When he´s down

         C             G
But I´m ready,yes I´m ready for you
       C                     G
I´m  standing on my own two feet
C                      G
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
    A                          B
Repeating to the sound of the beat
Refrão
