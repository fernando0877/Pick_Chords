There goes my baby, she knows how to rock and roll
                Bb5                E              
She drives me crazy, she gives me hot and cold fever
     A                              E
She leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

I gotta be cool,      relax

Get hip, get on my tracks
        D        D4  D            D4  D
Take a back seat,      hitch-hike
     G                      C     G        
And take a long ride on my motor bike 
           D
Until I'm ready
