I've paid my dues, time after time
             Cm       Gm                 Cm  Gm
I've done my sentence,   But commited no crime
           Eb    Ab           Eb  Ab
And bad mistakes, I've made a few
            Eb          Bb            Cm
I've had my share, sand kicked, in my face
    F             Bb
But Iiii've, come through,

              Bb4                       C7
I need to, go on, n’and on, and on, and on


F          Am            Dm   Bb  C
We are the champions, my friends
    F             Am                 Bb  D7/F#
And we'll keep on fighting, till the end
Gm         Gm         Bbm        C#dim
We are the champions, we are the champions
F            /G             Ab         /Bb      C7
No time, for losers, 'cause we are the champions
        Fm7   Cm  Fm7  Gm
Of the world


              Cm  Gm               Cm    Gm
I've taken my bows, And my curtain calls
               Cm              
You brought me fame and fortune
                    Gm                        Cm    Gm
and everything that goes with it, I thank you are

                        Eb   Ab
But it's been no bed of roseeees

No pleasure cruise
                Eb                    Bb          Cm
I consider it a challenge, before the whole human race
    F             Bb
And I ain't gonna lose

I need to, go on, n’and on, and on, and on
