Everybody Hurts
REM

D                    G         D
 When the day is long, and the night    
 the night is yours alone
 When you're sure you've had enough, of this life
 well hang on

Em                  A7  Em                A       Em
 Don't let yourself go, 'cause everybody cries
Em             A7        D    
 and everybody hurts sometimes (Hold on)

G                        D     
 Sometimes everything is wrong,
G                       D
 now it's time to sing along

                         G
 When your day is night alone
D                         G                   D
 If you feel like letting go
D                              G              D              G    
 When you think you've had too much, of this life, well hang on

Em          A7    Em                     A7 
  Everybody hurts,  take comfort in your friends
Em                A
  Everybody hurts,

F#                  Bm    
   Don't throw your hand, oooh  no  (2x)

C                            G     C                      Am
  when you feel like you're alone,   no no no, youre not alone

D    D                G            D 
  If you, are on your own, in this life,
     D                    G
 the days and nights are long
D                              G             D             G
  When you sure, youve had too much, of this life, to hang on
