Imitation of Life
REM

Em             Am    G         D
 Charades, pop skill, Water hyacinth,  
            Em       Am        G    D  C
 named by a poet, Imitation of life
Em       Am        G
  Like a coin in a frozen pond
D                    Em
Like a goldfish in a bowl
Am              G           D  C
I don't want to hear you cry

     G               Em
That sugar cane that tasted good
      Am               C    D
Thats cinnamon, that's hollywood
     G              Em              Am   C  D 
Come on, come on no one can see you try

Em             Am
 You want the greatest thing
    G                    D
The greatest thing since bread came sliced
Em             Am                 G     D  C
 You've got it all, you've got it sized
Em      Am             G             D                  Em
 Like a friday fashion show teenager Freezing in the corner
Am                  G             D  C
Trying to look like you don't try

     G              Em
That sugar cane that tasted good
     Am                    C        D
That freezing rain, that's what you could
     G               Em              Am    C  D4  D4
Come on, come on no one can see you try

     G                Em
This sugar cane, this lemonade
     Am             C    D
This hurricane, I'm not afraid
     G               Em              Am    C  D
Come mon, come on no one can see me cry
     G                     Em
This lightning storm, this tidal wave
     Am             C    D
This avalanche, I'm not afraid
     G               Em              Am    C  D
Come on, come on no one can see me cry
        G              Em
That sugar cane that tasted good
          Am                  C        D
that's who you are, that's what you could
     G               Em              Am  C  D
Come on, come on, no one can see you cry
