G   Am  
Oh, life is bigger, 
     Em                            Am
It's bigger, than you, and you are not me
                         Em                          Am
The lengths that I, will go to, The distance in your eyes
Em                     Dm             G   / (lick começa no 2)
  Oh no, I've said too much, set it, it up

                 Am
That's me in the corner,
                 Em                       Am
That's me in the spot, light, Losing my religion,
          Em                    Am
Trying the keep, up, you, And I don't know, if I can do it,
Em                     Dm                    G
  Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough

  G              /(lick)   F
I thought that I heard you laughing
                 G /(lick)  Am
I thought that I heard you sing
   F                 G        Am   G
I, think I thought I saw you try

/(lick)  Am                    Em
   Every whisper, every waking hour,
                   Am                  Em
I'm choosing my confessions, Trying to keep, an eye on you,
       Am
Like a hurt lost, and blinded fool, fool, 
Em                     Dm                    G
  Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough

         Am                       Em                           
Consider this, Consider this, The hint of the century, 
         Am                  Em
Consider this, The slip,that brought me To my knees, failed
Am
What if all, these fantasies Come
Em                                 Dm        G
  Flailing in the ground, Now I've said, too much

  G              /(lick)   F
I thought that I heard you laughing
                 G /(lick)  Am
I thought that I heard you sing
   F                 G        Am  
I, think I thought I saw you try

F
(lick caindo)
that was just a dream, That was just a dream

That's me in the corner (...)


that was just a dream, Try, cry, Why try?
That was just a dream, just a dream, just a dream, Dream
(lick na mesma nota, até comecar cair no fim)
