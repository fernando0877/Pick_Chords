Mott the Hoople and the game of Life, Yeah, yeah..
Andy Kaufman in the wrestling match

Let's play twister, let's play Risk
I'll see you in heaven if you make the list

Now Andy did you hear about this one?
Am                             G
Tell me are you locked in the punch?
Am                      G

Moses went walking with a staff of wood, Yeah, yeah..
Newton got beaned by the apple good
Egypt was troubled by the horrible asp
Mr. Charles Darwin had the gall to ask

Here's a little agit for the never believer
Here's a little ghost for the offering
Here's a truck stop instead of St. Peter's
Mr. Andy Kaufman's gone wrestling
