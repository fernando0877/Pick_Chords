Orange Crush
REM

E7
Follow me, don't follow me
     G                  D             E7
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush

Collar me don't collar me
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush

We are agents of the free
I've had my fun and now its time

   E
To serve Your conscience overseas
G              D
Coming in fast over me

E  B  F#  B
Oooooohhhhh (2x)

Aaahhhhh(Paid in full)
