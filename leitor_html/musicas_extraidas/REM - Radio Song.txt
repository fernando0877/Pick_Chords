When I got to the house and I called you out
        E               E7       E            E7
I could tell that you had been crying, crying.

It's that same sing song on the radio.  It makes me

No, I can't hear it

( A D )
            E        
Hey, hey, hey (say what)
Hey, hey, hey (let me do that with you)
Hey, hey, hey, hey ,hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, (say what, say what, say 
what)
Hey, hey, hey
Check it out
What are you saying
What are you playing
Who are you obeying
day out day in?
Baby baby baby
That stuff is driving me crazy
DJs communicate to the masses
Sex and violent classes
Now our children grow up prisoners
All their lives radio listeners
