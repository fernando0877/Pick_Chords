When you were here before, couldn't look you, in the eyes
                    C                         Cm
You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
                 G                       B7
You float like a feather, in a beautiful world

I wish I was special, you're so fucking special

          G            B7
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                          C               Cm
What the hell, am I doing here? I don't belong here

                   G                      B7
I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control
                 C                      Cm
I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul
              G                     B7
I want you to notice, when I'm not around
                  C                     Cm
You're so fucking special, I wish I was special

          G            B7
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                          C               Cm
What the hell, am I doing here? I don't belong here

                    G                     B7
Oooh, oooh, ohhhh...she's running out the door...
C                      Cm                
She's running out, she run, run, run...

Whatever makes you happy, whatever you want
                  C                     Cm
You're so fucking special, I wish I was special

          G            B
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                         C               Cm
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here
          G
