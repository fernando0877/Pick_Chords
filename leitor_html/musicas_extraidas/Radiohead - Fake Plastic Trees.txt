Fake Plastic Trees
Radiohead

A                        A4      D7M(9)/F#
  Her green plastic watering can
                           E    D9
  For her fake chinese rubber plant
                A     D9    A
  In the fake plastic earth
                             A4     D7M(9)/F#
  That she bought from a rubber man
                        E    D9
  In a town full of rubber plans
          A        D9
  To get rid of itself

      D9/C#    Bm                 A
  It wears her out,  It wears her out (2x)

                       A4    D7M(9)/F#
  She lives with a broken man
                    E    D9
  A cracked polystyrene man
             A           D9
  Who just crumbles and burns
A                   A4  D7M(9)/F#
  He used to do surgery
                      E    D9
  For girls in the eighties
        A        D9
  But gravity always wins

      D9/C#    Bm                 A
  It wears her out,  It wears her out (2x)

                      A4        D7M(9)/F#
  She looks like the real thing
                        E    D9
  She tastes like the real thing
            A    D9
  My fake plastic love
A                        A4    D7M(9)/F#
  But I can't help the feeling
                               E   D9
  I could blow through the ceiling
        A             D9
  If I just turn and run

      D9/C#    Bm                 A
  It wears her out,  It wears her out (2x)

                  Bm
  And if I could be who you wanted
              A
  If I could be who you wanted
           Bm            A
  All the time, all the time
