Two jumps in a week
          A9                                  E   Esus4  E
I bet you think that's pretty clever don't you boy
F#m11
Flying on your motorcycle
A9                                 E    Esus4  E   
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
      F#m11
You'd kill yourself for recognition
A9                         E    Esus4  E
Kill yourself to never ever stop
    F#m11
You broke another mirror
       A9                            E   Esus4  E
You're turning into something you are not

               F#m11  A9   
Don't leave me high 
               E
Don't leave me dry
               F#m11  A9   
Don't leave me high 
               E
Don't leave me dry

F#m11
Drying up in conversation
A9                            E    Esus4  E
You will be the one who cannot talk
F#m11
All your insides fall to pieces
A9                                   E              Esus4  E  
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
F#m11
They're the ones who'll hate you
         A9                             E         Esus4  E
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
F#m11
They're the ones who'll spit at you
    A9                   E       Esus4  E
You will be the one screaming out

         F#m11
It's the best thing that you ever had
    A9                           E  
The best thing that you ever, ever had
         F#m11                 
It's the best thing that you ever had
    A9                              E    Esus4  E
The best thing you ever had has gone away
