Hey ho, let's go

        A                       D   E 
They're forming in, straight line
        A                        D   E 
They're going through, a tight one
         A                          D   E 
The kids are, losing, their minds

The Blitz krieg Bop

        A                      D   E 
They're piling, in the back seat
        A                    D   E 
They're generating, steam heat
   A                       D   E 
Pulsating, to the back beat
                A   D   A

Hey ho, let's go
A                        D   A 
Shoot'em, in the back now

What they want, I don't know
        B                  D        E 
They're all, raved up, and ready to go
