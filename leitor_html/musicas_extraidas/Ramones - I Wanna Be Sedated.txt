I Wanna Be Sedated
Ramones

  E 
Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
A                E 
   I wanna be sedated

Nothin' to do, and no where, to go ooh
A                E 
   I wanna be sedated

      B                     E 
Just get me to the airport, put me on a plane
 B                   E 
Hurry hurry hurry before I go insane
   B                          E 
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
    A            B 
Oh no no no no no
