I saw her today, I saw her face, 
                  Em
It was the face I loved,
                          G
And I knew I had to, run away, 
                             Em
And get down on my knees and pray, 
                              G
that they go away, Still it begins, 
            Em
Needles and pins, 
                  C                        D7
Because of all my pride, The tears I gotta hide

                     G
Oh, I thought I was smart, 
                                     Em
I stole her heart,  Didn't think I'd do,
                                       G
but now I see, She's worth to him than me,
                                   Em
let her go ahead, Take his love instead, 
                                           G
and one day she will see, Just how, to say please, 

                    Em
And get down on her knees, 
                   C
Oh that's how it begins,
