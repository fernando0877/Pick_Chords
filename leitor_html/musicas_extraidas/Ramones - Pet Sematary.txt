Pet Sematary
Ramones

D5          E5        F5
  Under the arc of a weather stain boards
D5         E5      F5
  Ancient goblins, and warlords
D5                  E5         F5
  Come out of the ground, not making a sound
D5              E5      F5
  The smell of death is all around

C5                        D5
  And the night when the cold wind blows
C5              D5      Bb5  C5
  No one cares Nobody knows

D5                F5
I don't wanna be buried      
      C5      Bb5
In a pet sematary
D5                 C5            Bb5  C5
  I don't want to live my life again

D5        E5            F5
  Follow Victor to the sacred place
D5               E5      F5
  This ain't a dream, I can't scape
D5            E5          F5
  Molars and fangs, the clicking of bones
D5         E5       F5
  Spirits moaning among the tombstones

C5                         D5
  And the night, when the moon is bright
C5                D5              Bb5
  Someone cries, something ain't right

(Refr√£o) Bb5  D5  E5  F5  Bb5  C5

D5             E5       F5
  The moon is full, the air is still
D5          E5       F5
  All of a sudden I feel a chill
D5            E5             F5
  Victor is grinning, flesh rotting away
D5           E5       F5
  Skeletons dance, I curse this day

C5                         D5
  And the night, when the wolves cry out
C5                  D5               Bb
  Listen close and you can hear me shout

    D5  C5    Bb5
Oh no,    oh no
C5                 D5          C5
  I don't want to live my live
       Bb5  C5
Life again
