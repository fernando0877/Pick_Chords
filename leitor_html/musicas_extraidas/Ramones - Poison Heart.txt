Poison Heart
Ramones

C#m          E      C#m          E 
No one ever thought this one would survive
C#m             E             A         B 
Helpless child, gonna walk a drum beat behind
C#m            E     C#m          E 
Lock you in a dream, never let you go
C#m          E         A         B 
Never let you laugh or smile, not you

       A             B           C#m     B     A 
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world
       A        B            C#m
'Cause everybody has a poison heart (2x)


C#m                     E        C#m          E 
Making friends with a homeless torn up man
C#m      E                     A          B 
He just kind of smiles, it really shakes me up
C#m                       E          C#m     E 
There's danger on every corner but I'm okay
C#m              E                 A          B 
Walking down the street trying to forget yesterday

   A             B            C#m     B      A 
I just want to walk right out of this world
        A      B            C#m    
'Cause everybody has a poison heart (2x)

B            C#m B             C#m   B            A 
  A  poison heart, a poison heart, a poison heart

C#m    E      C#m        E 
You know that life really takes its toll
         C#m       E             A          B 
And a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul
 C#m             E        C#m       E 
So much damn confusion before my eyes
        C#m             E           A                 B 
But nothing seems to phase me and this one still survives
