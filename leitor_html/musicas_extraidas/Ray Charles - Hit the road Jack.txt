Hit the road Jack
Ray Charles

Am   G     F    E7

        Am   G         F               E7   7
Hit the road Jack, and don't you, come back 
   Am       G        F        E
no more, no more, no more, no more.
        Am   G       F               E7      Am  G F E7
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more

   Am        G            F            E7
Oh woman, oh woman, don't treat me, so mean,
           Am           G                F    E7 
You're the meanest, old woman, that I've ever seen

  Am        G        F  E7
I guess, if you, say so
     Am               G           F           E7
I'll have to pack, my things, and go. (That's right)

refr√£o:

    Am           G             F                E7
Now baby, listen baby, don't-a treat me, this-a way
    Am       G           F          E7
For I'll be, back, on my feet, some day
   
      Am           G             F      E7
Don't care, if you do, cause its understood
          Am      G          F              E7
you ain't got, no money, you just, ain't no good

        Am        G        F    E7
Well, I guess, if you, say so
     Am               G           F           E7
I'll have to pack, my things, and go. (That's right)
