 C4(7)  C7(9)  C4(7/13)  C
Gm7(11)
I like pleasure spiked with pain
     C7                    Gm7(11)       C7
And music is my aeroplane, It's my aeroplane
 Gm7(11)
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
     C7                    Gm7(11)       C7
And music is my aeroplane, It's my aeroplane

Gm7(11)  C7
Pleasure spiked with pain
                        Gm7(11)             C7
That motherfucker's always, Spiked with pain

Gm7                   C7
Looking in my own eyes    hello
Gm7                      C7
I can't find the love I want
 Gm7                   C7
Someone better slap me
                   Gm7
Before I start to rust
                   C7
Before I start to decompose

 Gm7                        C7
Looking in my rear view mirror
 Gm7                        C7
Looking in my rear view mirror
Gm7                     C7
I can make it disappear
Gm7                     C7
    I can make it disappear, Have no fear (Refrão:)

 Gm7                  C7
Sitting in my kitchen    hey girl
     Gm7                C7
I'm turning into dust again
    Gm7            C7
My melancholy baby
                   Gm7
The star of mazzy must
                  C7
Push her voice inside of me
    Gm7              C7
I'm overcoming gravity
    Gm7              C7
I'm overcoming gravity
     Gm7                   C7
It's easy when you're sad to be
     Gm7                  C7
It's easy when you're sad, Sad like me
Refrão:

Pleasure spiked with pain
Just one note
Could make me float
Could make me float away
One note from
The song she wrote
Could fuck me where I lay
Just one note
Could make me choke
One note that's not a lie

Just one note
Could cut my throat
One note could make me die
