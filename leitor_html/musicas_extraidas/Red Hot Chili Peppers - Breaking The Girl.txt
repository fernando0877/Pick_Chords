I am a man  cut from the know

Rarely do friend´s come and then go

She was a girl  soft but estranged
            C/A  D/A           A
We were the two  our lives rearranged

Feeling so good that day
C            G         F
A feeling of love that day


Am           G            C            D
Twisting and turning your feelings are burning
       E            D     C   G
You´re breaking the girl
Am  G     C   D  F
She meant you no harm
Am              G          C            D
Think you´re so clever but now you must sever
       E            D     C   G
You´re breaking the girl
Am  G     C  D   F

Raised by my dad  girl of the day
          C/A  D/A          A
He was my man  that was the way

She was the girl  left alone

Feeling the need to make me her home


C            G            Am
I don´t know what when or why
C               G          F
The twilight of love had arrived
