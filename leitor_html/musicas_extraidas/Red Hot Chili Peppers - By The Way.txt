By The Way
Red Hot Chili Peppers

F                           C
Standing in line to see the show tonight
              Am
And there's a light on, heavy glow
F            C                Am
By the way I tried to say I'd be there, waiting for

F                        C
Dani the girl is singing songs to me
            Am
Beneath the marquee, overload

Dm
Steak knife, Card Shark
Con job, Boot cut
Dm
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
Get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic but not the way that we play

Dm
Dog town, Blood bath
Rib cage, Soft tail

F                           C
Standing in line to see the show tonight
              Dm
And there's a light on, heavy glow
F            C                Am        Bb
By the way I tried to say I'd be there, waiting for

Dm
Black jack, Dope dick
Pawn shop, Quick pick
Dm
Kiss that dyke, I know you want to hold one
Not on strike, but I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic, I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story so I told one

Dm
Song bird, Main line
Cash back, Hard top

F                           C
Standing in line to see the show tonight
              Am
And there's a light on, heavy glow
F            C                Am
By the way I tried to say I'd be there, waiting for

F                        C
Dani the girl is singing songs to me
            Am
Beneath the marquee... of her soul
F            C                Am
By the way I tried to say I'd be there, waiting for

Dm
Ooh ahh, 'guess you never meant it (7x)

F                           C
Standing in line to see the show tonight
              Dm
And there's a light on, heavy glow

By the way I tried to say I'd be there, waiting for

F                        C
Dani the girl is singing songs to me
            Dm
Beneath the marquee, of her soul
F            C              Am        Bb
By the way I tried to say I know you, from before

F                           C
Standing in line to see the show tonight
               Dm
And there's a light on, heavy glow
F            C                Am        Bb         Dm
By the way I tried to say I'd be there, waiting for
