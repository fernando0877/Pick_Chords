Otherside
Red Hot Chili Peppers

Am               F            C
  How long, how long will I slide?
 G           Am   F
Separate my side
   C      G                  Am  F
I don't, don't believe it's bad
  C                     G
Slittin' my throat it's all I ever

Am                               Em
  I heard your voice through a photograph
Am                            Em
  I thought it up and brought up the past
Am                       Em
  Once you know you can never go back
             G             Am
I've got to take it on the otherside

Am                       Em
  Centuries are what it meant to me
Am                    Em
  A cemetery where I marry the sea
Am                        Em
  Stranger things never change my mind
             G             Am
I've got to take it on the otherside
 G             Am
Take it on the otherside
 G
Take it on
 Am
Take it on

Am               F            C
  How long, how long will I slide?
 G           Am   F
Separate my side
   C      G                  Am  F
I don't, don't believe it's bad
  C                     G
Slittin' my throat it's all I ever

Am                     Em
  Pour my life into a paper cup
Am                             Em
  The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
Am                         Em
  She wants to know am I still a slut
             G             Am
I've got to take it on the otherside

Am                          Em
  Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
Am                    Em
  A candidate for my soul mate bled
Am                      Em
  Push the trigger and pull the thread
             G             Am
I've got to take it on the otherside
 G             Am
Take it on the otherside
 G
Take it on
 Am
Take it on

Am               F            C
  How long, how long will I slide?
 G           Am   F
Separate my side
   C      G                  Am  F
I don't, don't believe it's bad
  C                     G
Slittin' my throat it's all I ever

Em
  Turn me on take me for a hard ride
C             G
 Burn me out leave me on the otherside
Em
 I yell and tell it that

 It's not my friend
            C
 I tear it down I tear it down
                G
 And then it's born again

Am               F            C
  How long, how long will I slide?
 G           Am   F
Separate my side
   C      G                  Am  F
I don't, don't believe it's bad
  C                     G
Slittin' my throat it's all I ever
