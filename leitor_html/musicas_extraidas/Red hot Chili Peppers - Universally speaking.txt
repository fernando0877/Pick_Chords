D          Em7               D
I saw your face, Elegant and tired
                Em7                  D
Cut up from the chase, Still, I so admired
                Em7                D
Bloodshot your smile, Delicate and wild
                   Em7                         D
Give me she, wolf style, Rip right through me

D
 Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Em7
 Go and get her, I've got her, on my mind
D
 Nothing better, the feeling, is so fine
Em7                                 D
 Simply put, I saw your love stream flow

Come on, baby, 'cause there's no name for

Give it up, and I got, what I came for
G        Bm        
Universally speaking I

 Take it back, and you make, me nervous

Nothing better, than love and service

I saw your crime, Dying to get high

Two of a kind, Beats all hands tonight
