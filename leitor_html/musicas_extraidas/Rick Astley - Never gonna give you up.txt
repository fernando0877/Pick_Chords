We've known each other for so long

Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
E                                Gb
Inside we both know what's been going on
E                           Gb
We know the game and we're gonna play it
E           Gb
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
E                         Gb
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
