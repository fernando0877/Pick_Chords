Em
Wise men say that rushing is violence
    Am
And so is your silence when it's rooted in compliance
Em
To stand firm in loving defiance
    Am
Make art your alliance, Give voice to the fire

Em
Move people to the beat of the wind
         Am
Gather yourself and begin, to dance the song until it ends
Em
We are winners, champions of the light
         Am
Forming in numbers and might, Keep the truth close in sight

         Em              Am

      Em                                          Am
Walking with grace, I know your face, and I trust your hand (2x)

Until the message is in action and
Em
Your yard is feeding

Stop stark the disbelieving
         Am
Cause the garden holds the shards

The medicine is in the seeds when
Em
We hold tight to our right to protect and
Am
We know our might is 10-fold in connection
Em
Our elders hold them bright lights

We protect them
     Am
The medicine is evident

The wolf, the hawk, the bear clan

Em
We hold tight to our right to protect and
Am
We know our might is 10-fold in connection
Em
Our elders hold them bright lights

We protect them
     Am
The medicine is evident

The wolf, the hawk, the bear clan
