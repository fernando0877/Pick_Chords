  Em             
A fool in love,
                   
a  crazy situation
           D      
Her velvet glove,
          Em
knocks me down and down and down and down

  Em            
A kiss of fire,
                    
a loaded invitation
           D      
Inside her smile,
             Em
she takes me down and down and down and down

C
Ahhh ahh ahh 3x

    Em                 
Her moves looked good,

a touch of desperation
             D
From where I stood,
                    Em
she turned my head around and round and round

Comes kinda hard,
       G                      C
when I hear your voice on the radio, 
(hear your voice on the radio)
G                        D
taking me back down that road,
              Em   C  
leads back to you, oh oh

29 Palms,
  G                     C
I feel the heat of your desert heart,

  Em            
A burnin' love,
                      
A Strange infatuation 
                D     
White cold cold touch,
            Em
what must I do and do and do and do

    Em                 
The heat and the dust,
                         
increased my desolation,
          D     
In God we trust
           Em
always for you and you and you and you
