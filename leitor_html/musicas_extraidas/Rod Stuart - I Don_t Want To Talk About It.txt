I Don't Want To Talk About It
Rod Stuart

Bm E4 E A9
       Bm
I can tell by your eyes
            E4             E        A9
That you've probably, been crying forever
         Bm
And the stars in the sky
           E4
don't mean nothing
    E             A9
To you they're a mirror


D               E
  I don't wanna   talk about it
A9         E/G#     F#m
   How you broke my heart
D                       E
  If I stay here just A little bit, longer
D                           E
  If I stay here won't you listen
      Bm   E4  E  A9
To my heart,   my heart


      Bm
If I stand all alone
          E4
Will the shadows hide
     E             A9
The colours of my heart
A9
Blue for the tears, Black for the night's


          Bm                         E4
fears The stars in the sky, don't mean nothing
    E             A9
To you they're a mirror
