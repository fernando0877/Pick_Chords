A                 G                            D
Wake up Maggie, I think I've got, something to say to you
     A                     G                 D
It's late September, and I really, should be back at school

  G                D            G              A
I know I keep you amused, But I feel I'm being used
   Em                      F#m        Em     Dsus2/F#
Oh Maggie, I couldn’t have tried, any more
    Em                A             Em                    A
You led, me away from home, just to save, you from being alone
    Em                  A                   D
You stole my heart, and that's, what really hurts

    A                     G                   D
The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
    A                   G                       D
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything

  G                   D         G                       A
I laughed at all your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax
   Em                     F#m       Em   Dsus2/F#  DM9/F#  A7sus2/E
Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
        Em           A            Em                  A
You led me away from home just to save you from being alone
    Em                     A          G      D
You stole my soul that's a pain I can do without

A                  G                D
All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
        A                       G                       D
But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover you wore me out

G                        D              G                      A
All you did was wreck my bed And in the morning kick me in the head
   Em                     F#m       Em   Dsus2/F#
Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
    Em               A               Em                 A
You led me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone
    Em                        A         G    D
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

A                 G                           D
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
   A                G                            D
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool

   G                           D         G               A
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand
   Em                 F#m             Em   Dsus2/F#
Oh Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
           Em                      A              Em                  A
You made a first class fool out of me, but I'm as blind as a fool can be
    Em                   A        G  D
You stole my heart but I love you anyway
