Am     E7     G               F                C
Angie, Angie, when will those clouds all disappear?
Am     E7     G             F            
Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from 
C
here?
        G                          Dm      
With no loving in our souls and no money in
     Am
 our coats
C         F              G
You can't say we're satisfied
    Am     E7     G         F            
But Angie, Angie, you can't say we never

tried

Am            E7         G            F  
Angie, you're beautiful, but ain't it 
               C
time we said good-bye?
Am             E7        G        F      
Angie, I still love you, remember all 
             C
those nights we cried?

        G                                 
All the dreams we held so close seemed to 
Dm           Am
all go up in smoke
C      F               G
Let me whisper in your ear

Am     E7     G             F            
Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from 
C
here?

    G                               Dm     
Oh, Angie, don't you weep, all your kisses 
            Am
still taste sweet
C           F               G
I hate that sadness in your eyes
    Am     E7     G        F            
But Angie, Angie, ain't it time we said 
     C
good-bye?
        G                          Dm      
With no loving in our souls and no money in
     Am
 our coats
C         F              G
You can't say we're satisfied

    Dm                       Am
But Angie, I still love you, baby
Dm                           Am
Ev'rywhere I look I see your eyes
Dm                             Am
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
C       F              G
Come on Baby, dry your eyes
    Am     E7     G        F          
But Angie, Angie, ain't it good to be 
 C
alive?
Am     E7     G          F            C  
Angie, Angie, they can't say we never 
   Dm  C
tried
