Anybody seen my baby
Rolling Stones

Am
She confessed her love to me
Then she vanished
On the breeze
Trying to hold on to that
Was just impossible

She was more than beautiful
Closer to ethereal
With a kind of
Down to earth flavor

Am           G6
Close my eyes
     Fmaj7            G6
It's three in the afternoon
     Am           G6
Then I realize
     Fmaj7
That she's really
E
Gone for good

Anybody seen my baby
        C    D  Em
Anybody seen her around
Love has gone
    C       D
And made me blind
     Gmaj7                      Em
I've looked but I just can't find
               C
She has gotten lost
D      Em
In the crowd

Am
I was flippin' magazines
In that place on Mercer Street
When I thought I spotted her

Getting on a motor bike
Looking rather lady like
Didn't she just give me a wave?

Am       G6
Salty tears
     Fmaj7             G6
It's three in the afternoon
Am            G6
Has she disappeared
Fmaj7                  E
Is she really gone for good

If I just close my eyes

I reach out   Em
And touch the prize
