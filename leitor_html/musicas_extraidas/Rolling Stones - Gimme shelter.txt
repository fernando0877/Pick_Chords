Gimme shelter
Rolling Stones

C#  B   A    

C# 
Ooh, a storm is threatening, my very life today
C# 
If I don't get some shelter, yeah I'm gonna fade away

C#    B        A                      
 War, children, it's just a shot away,
A     E      A     E 
 it's just a shot away (2x)

C# 
Ooh, see the fire, is sweepin, our very streets today
C# 
Burns, like a red coal carpet, mad bull lost its way


C#    B        A                      
 War, children, it's just a shot away,
A     E      A     E 
 it's just a shot away
C#    B        A                      
 Rape, murder, it's just a shot away,
A     E      A     E 
 it's just a shot away

C#
Mmm, the flood is threatening, my very life today
C#
Gimme, gimme shelter, or I'm gonna fade away

C#    B        A                      
 War, children, it's just a shot away,
A     E      A     E 
 it's just a shot away
C#    B        A                      
 I said, love, sister, it's just a kiss away,
A     E      A     E 
 it's just a kiss away (2x)
