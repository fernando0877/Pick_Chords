Honky Tonk Woman
Rolling Stones

  G                 G                C      C4 C
I met a, gin soaked bar, room queem, in memphis
    G                   A7              D    D4 D
She tried, to take me, upstairs, for a ride
    G                                    C        C4 C
She had to, heave me, right a-cross, her shoulder
        G                   D7                G   D7
´Cos I just, can´t seem to, drink you, off my mind

         G   D7          G
It's the hooooon-ky tonk women
G             D7                    G
gimme, gimme, gimme, the honky tonk blues

  G                                C    C4 C
I laid a, divorcee-in, in new york city
  G              A7                D    D4 D
I had to, put up some kiiin-d of a fight
    G                                C C4 C
The lady, then she covered me, with roses
    G                 D7                G
She blew my nose, and then, she blew my mind
