      B          Bm             B
I was born, in a crossfire hurricane,
And i howle, at my ma, in the driving rain


         D   A      E                   B
But its all right, now, in fact its a gas.
         D   A          E           
But its all right, Im jumping Jack Flash
       B              B4     B4 
its a gas, gas, gas


      B             Bm                 B
I was raised , by a toothless, bearded hag,
I was schooled, with a strap, right, across my back

refrão:


B   E   D   A/C# (4x)
B4 (2x) 
B  (riff 2x)

      B              Bm                      B
I was drowned, I was washed up, and left for dead,
I fell down, to my feet, and I saw, they bled

I frowned, at the crumbs, of a crust, of bread
I was crowned, a spike right, thru my head
refrão:

      B                E     D   A
    Jumping Jack Flas, its a gas (7x)
