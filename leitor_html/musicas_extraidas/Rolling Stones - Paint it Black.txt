Paint it Black
Rolling Stones

:Tom Em, capo 2a, forma Dm:
Dm                A
   I see, a red, door, and I want, it painted black
             Dm                    A
 no colors, any more, I want, them, to turn black
    Dm      C          F         Dm
 I see the girls, walk by dressed in their summer clothes
 Dm  C       F        C     G                 A
 I  have to turn, my head, until, the darkness goes

        Dm                      A
I see a line, of cars, and they're, all painted black
      Dm                           A
with flowers and my love both never to come back
 Dm  C         F                    Dm
I  see people turn their heads and quickly look away
  Dm      C       F   C        G             A
 Like a new born baby it just happens every day

   Dm                     A
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
   Dm                       A
I see my red door and I want it painted black
  Dm     C         F            Dm
 Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the fact
 Dm        C    F     C        G                    A
 It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

      Dm                        A
No more will my green, sea go turn a deeper blue
         Dm                             A
I could not forsee this thing happening to you
 Dm   C        F     C       Dm
If   I  look hard enough into the setting sun
  Dm   C       F          C    G                A
My love will laugh with me, before the morning comes

1a estrofe + uhhmmmmm (4x) 

                                 Dm                        A
I want to see your face, painted black, black as night
                      Dm         A
 Don't wanna see the sun flying high in the sky
                Dm                                  A
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black Yeah
