'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
         E7     D/F#
 I can't get no,   I can't get no

         E7            D/F#
When I'm drivin' in my car, 
And that man, comes on, the radio
He's tellin' me, more and more, 
About some useless, information
Supposed to, fire, my imagination,

I can't get no,oh nonono
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say
:1a estrofe:

When I'm watchin' my TV, 
And that, man comes, on to tells me
How white, my shirts can be, 
But he, cant be a man, cause he doesnt smoke
The same cigarettes as me

I can't get no, oh, no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say
:1a estrofe:

When I'm ridin, round the world,
And I'm, doin this, and I'm signing that
And I'm tryin' to make, some girl,
Who Tells me, baby better, Come back, later next week,
'Cause you see, I'm on, on losing streak

I can't get no, oh, no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say
:1a estrofe:

 I can't get no, satisfaction (6x)
