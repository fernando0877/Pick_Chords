D                   B            A
Wading, through the waste, stormy winter
D                  B7                  A
And there's, not a friend, to help you through
D                B7                 A             D
Trying, stop the waves, behind your eyebaaaaalls stoned
A               E                    A
Drop your reds, drop your greens and blues

D                   B7        A
Thank you, for your wine, California
D                   B7                A
Thank you, for your sweet, and bitter fruits
D              B7             A           D
Yes I, got the desert, in my toenaaaaail stoned
A              E               A    A7
And I hid, the speed inside my shoe

    D                B7              A
But come on, come on down, Sweet Virginia
D              B7               A  A7
Come on, honey child, I beg of you
D                B7                  A           D
Come on, come on down, you got it in yooou, you hesrt

A                   E                    A
Got to scrape, that shit right off, your shoes
