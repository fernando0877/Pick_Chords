Bm          G       Bm           G
  Childhood living,   is easy to do
Am               C      D  G                  D    C
  The things you wanted,    I bought them for you
Bm          G      Bm               G
  Graceless lady,     you know who I am
Am                  C       D G                D       C
   You know I can't let you,  slide through my hands

Am     C      D  G         F        C
  Wild Horses     couldn't drag me away (2x)

Bm              G      Bm              G
I watched you suffer   a dull aching pain
Am          C     D  G               D     C
Now you decided     to show me the same
Bm               G      Bm            G
No sweet thing exits    oh of stage blinds
Am                 C      D     G          D     C
Could make me be bitter     or treat you unkind

Bm            G           Bm                 G
I know I've drained you   it seemed like a lie
Am          C       D  G                      D     C
I have my freedom      but I don't have much time
Bm             G      Bm              G
Faith has been broken   tears must be cried
Am           C      D  G            D     C
Lets do some living     after we've died
