F                  Bb        F
 Tried to make it little by little
                 Bb     F           C
Tried to make it bit by bit on my own
 F                    Bb     F
  Quit the job, the grey believers
                    Bb      F              C
 Another town where I get close to the bone

                           Bb      F
 Whatcha gonna tell your brother? oh
                          Bb                F
 Whatcha gonna tell your father?  I don't know!
                          Bb              Dm  C  Bb
 Whatcha gonna tell your mother? Let me go

   Gm           Bb        C         Bb
 Shaping me up for the big time, baby

F
 I'm not afraid
    Bb        F
A trembling flower
                           Bb
I'll feed your heart and blow
     F               C  C4  C
The dust from your eyes
F                 Bb           F
And in the dark things happen faster
F
 I love the way you
 Bb        F            C  C4  C
Sway your hips next to mine
