Fading Like A Flower

      Dm
In a time
           Am            Dm
Where the sun descends alone
         F         C        Dm
I ran a long long way from home
           Am                    G
To find a heart that's made of stone

         Dm
I will try
        Am            Dm
I just need a little time
             F          C         Dm
To get your face right out of my mind
            Am                     G
To see the world through different eyes

F             Bb            Dm    C
Every time I see you oh I try to hide away
 F        Bb                 C         F
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
F               Bb                Dm      C         
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like
     Bb   C
 a flower

          Dm
Tell me why?
          Am                 Dm
When i scream there's no reply
        F                 C          Dm
When i reach out there's nothing to find
         Am                     G
When I sleep I break down and cry

F             Bb            Dm    C
Every time I see you oh I try to hide away
 F        Bb                 C         F
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
F               Bb               Dm       C         
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm fading like
     Bb   C
 a flower

               D5  C5  F5  G5
Fading like a rose
               D5  C5  F5  G5
Fading like a rose
                D5  C5  F5  G5
Beaten by the storm
              A
Talking to myself, getting washed by the rain
                       Dm
It's such a cold cold town

Dm  F  C
