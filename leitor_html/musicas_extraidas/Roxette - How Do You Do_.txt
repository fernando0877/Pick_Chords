 I see you comb your hair and gimme that grin.
        F5          C5        F5          G5
 It's making me spin  now, spinnin' within.
              F5         C5   F5       G5   F5      
 Before I melt like snow,  I say Hello - How do you 
   C5   F5  G5
do!


 I love the way you undress now. Baby begin.
 Do your caress, honey, my heart's in a mess.
 I love your blue-eyed voice, like Tiny Tim shines 
thru. How do you do!

 Well, here we are  crackin' jokes in the corner  of  
our mouths
       Fmaj7                              C
 and I feel like I'm laughing in a dream.
           Am
 If I was young I could wait outside your school
 Am/G                                  Fmaj7     G
  cos your face is like the cover of a magazine.


            Eb5                 Bb5
 How do you do, do you do, the things that you do.
            Eb5      Ab5       Bb5
 No one I know could ever keep up with you.
            C5         Ab5        Bb5                
 How do you do! Did it ever make sense to you to say 
C5  Ab5 Bb5
Bye Bye Bye?


 I see you in that chair with perfect skin.
 Well, how have you been, baby, livin' in sin?
 Hey, I gotta know, did you say Hello - How do you do?

 Well, here we are spending time in the louder part of
 town
 and it feels like everything's surreal.
 When I get old I will wait outside your house
 cos your hands have got the power meant to heal.

 How do you do...

 Well, here we are crackin' jokes...(how do you do!)

 Well, here we are spending time...

            F5                  C5
 How do you do, do you do, the things that you do.
          F5         Bb5               C5
 No one I know could ever keep up with you.
            D5         Bb5       C5
 How do you do! Did it ever make sense to you  to
     D5  Bb5 C5
say Bye Bye Bye?
