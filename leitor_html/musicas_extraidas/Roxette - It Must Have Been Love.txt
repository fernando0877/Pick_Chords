It Must Have Been Love
Roxette

Capo 6, tom F#, forma C
C  F
    C                            F
It must have been love, but its over now

        C
Lay a whisper, on my pillow
          F              G
Leave the winter, on the ground
            C                    F
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
       Dm                G
In the bedroom, and all around
         Am               C               F      G
Touch me now, I close my eyes, and dream away

                  C                  F
It must have been love, but its over now
                       Dm       Am          G
It must have been good,  but I lost it somehow
                    C                F
It must have been love but its over now
                       Dm            Am           G
From the moment we touched till the time had run out

          C
Make believing, we're together
          F                 G
That I'm sheltered by hour heart
              C                    F
But in and outside I've turned to water
         Dm            G
Like a teardrop in your palm
            Am          C           F       G
And its hard, winter's day, I dream away

                     C                 F
It must have been love, but its over now
              Dm             Am         G
It was all I wanted now, I'm living without
                      C             Gm
It must have been love but its over now
               C                         Bb
Its where the water flows, its where the wind blows

Dm  C  Bb  Dm
F  C  Bb  Dm  C
