Joyride
Roxette

A
  Hit the road out of nowhere
A
  Had to jump in my car
A
  Be a rider in the love game
A
  Following the stars
D
  Don't need no book of wisdom
Bm                           A
  I get no money-talk at all
A
  She has a train going downtown
A
  She's got a club on the moon
A
  And she's telling all her secrets
A
  In a wonderful balloon
D
  She's the heart of the funfair
Bm                                  A
  She got me whistling her private tune

       E      D            A
And it all begins where it ends
          E           D
And she's all my, my magic friend

           A         G      D
She says "Hello you fool I love you
A                        D
  C'mon join the joyride
          A
Join the joyride"

A
  She's a flower - I can paint her
A
  She's a child of the sun
A
  We're a part of this together
A
  Could never turn around and run
D
  Don't need no fortune teller
Bm
  To know where my lucky love belongs

         E      D                 A
Cause it all begins again when it ends
          E    D
And we're all magic friends

              A      G      D
She says "Hello you fool I love you
A                        D
  C'mon join the joyride
          A
Join the joyride"
              A      G      D
She says "Hello you fool I love you
A                        D
  C'mon join the joyride
      A
Be a joyrider"

I'll take you on a skyride

Feeling like you're spellbound
 A5
Sunshine is a lady

Rocks you like a baby
