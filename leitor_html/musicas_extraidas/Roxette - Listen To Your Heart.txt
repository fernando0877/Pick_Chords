Listen To Your Heart
Roxette

Bm  G  A  Bm
Bm                 G              A             Bm
 I know thereâ€™s something in the wake of your smile
         G               A           Bm
I get a notion from the look in your eyes
             G                A           Bm
You've built a love but that love falls apart
                            G            Em
Your little piece of heaven,  turns too dark

                Bm   G
Listen to your heart
           D           A
When he's calling for you
                Bm   G
Listen to your heart
                D             A
There's nothing else you can do
          D                A
I don't know where you're going
    G              D
And I don't know why
                    Bm   G
But listen to your heart
       A                   Bm
Before   you tell him goodbye

Bm     G                        A              Bm
  Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
              G               A           Bm
The precious moments are all lost in the tide
              G         A                  Bm
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems
                         G           Em
The feeling of belonging   to your dreams

                Bm   G
Listen to your heart
           D           A
When he's calling for you
                Bm   G
Listen to your heart
                D             A
There's nothing else you can do
          D                A
I don't know where you're going
       G           D
And I don't know why
                    Bm   G
But listen to your heart
       A                   Bm
Before   you tell him goodbye

E
  And there are voices

That want to be heard
C#m
  So much to mention

But you can't find the words
B
  The scent of magic
     A
The beauty that's been
B
  When love was wilder
C#
  Than the wind
