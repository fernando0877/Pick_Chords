Spending My Time

Capotraste na 2Âª casa
           Em               Am       D4      D
What's the time, seems it's already morning
           Em          C             D4     D
I see the sky, it's so beautiful and blue
         Em         C          D                      
The tv's on but the only thing showing is a picture of
 Asus2       Am
 you

         Em     C           D4   D
Oh I get up and make myself some coffee
         Em                  C            D4   D
I try to read a bit, but the story is too thin
            Em         C                  D4   D
I thank the Lord above you're not here to see me
                A       Am
In this shape I'm in

            D       D4  D
Spending my time
             A
Watching the days go by
           Bm                    G
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
            Em   G           A
Hoping that you think of me too
                Bm
I'm spending my time

         Em         Am                 D4     D
I try to call but I don't know what to tell you
          Em           Am           D4   D
I leave a kiss on your answering machine
           Em               Am             D4      D
Oh help me please is there someone who can make me
                     A    Am
Wake up from this dream?

            D       D4  D
Spending my time
             A
Watching the days go by
           Bm                    G
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
             Em     G           A
Hoping that you are missing me too

            D       D4  D
Spending my time
                 A
Watching the sun go down
                      Bm
I fall asleep to the sound
                G
Of "tears of a clown"
             Em     A
A prayer gone blind
                Bm
I'm spending my time

Em               G              D            C
 My friends keep telling me hey life will go on
Em         G                  D
 Time will make sure I'll get over you ooh
Em          G
 This silly game of love
    D              A       C    B
You play, you win, only to lose

                E
I'm spending my time
               B
Watching the days go by
            C#m                   A
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
             F#m A          B
Hoping that you think of me too
                E
I'm spending my time
             B
Watching the sun go down
                      C#m
I fall asleep to the sound
                   A
of the Tears of a clown
               F#m
A prayer gone blind...

B                C#m
 I'm spending my time...
