I knew he was different in his sexuality
Gm            Gm/A            F
I went to his parties as the straight minority
   Gm                F         Bb9
He never seemed a threat to my masculinity

When I heard that he was gone 
         Dm              C9    Bb9
I felt a shadow cross my heart 

                  Dm
But he's nobody's Hero

I didn't know the girl, but I knew her family
Gm                   Gm/A            F
All their lives were shattered, in a nightmare of brutality
     Gm             F            Bb9
They tried to carry on, tried to bear the agony
Gm                 Gm/A          F
Tried to hold some faith, in the goodness of humanity
