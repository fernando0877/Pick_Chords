Spirit of Radio
Rush

E    B    G#m  A 
Begin the day, with a friendly voice, 
a companion unobtrusive
Plays that song that's so elusive, 
and the magic music 
makes your morning mood

Off on your way, hit the open road, 
there is magic at your fingers
For the Spirit ever lingers, 
undemanding contact 
in your happy solitude

  E  D/F#  E/G#  D/F#   E
  Invisible airwaves 
  crackle with life,
  bright antenna 
  bristle with the energy
  
  Emotional feedback 
  on timeless wavelength, 
  bearing a gift beyond 
  price, almost free

All this machinery 
making modern music, 
can still be open-hearted

Not so coldly charted, 
it's really just a question, 
of your honesty, 
yeah, your honesty

One likes to believe 
in the freedom of music 
But glittering prizes 
and endless compromises, 
shatter the illusion of integrity

REFR√ÉO

For the words of the prophets 
were written on the studio wall, 
concert hall

And echoes 
with the sounds of salesmen 
of salesmen, of salesmen
