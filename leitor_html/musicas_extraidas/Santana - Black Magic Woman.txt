Dm7                                            Am7
I got a black magic woman, I got a black magic woman
                Dm7                                       Gm
I got a black magic woman got me so blind I can't see
             Dm7                     A7                            Dm
That she's a black magic woman she's tryin' to make a devil out of me


Dm7                                                         Am7
Don't turn your back on me baby, Don't turn your back on me baby
                     Dm7                                             Gm
Yes, don't turn your back on me baby, stop messin' around with your tricks
                Dm7                 A7                          Dm
Don't turn your back on me baby you just might pick up my magic sticks


Dm7                                             Am7
Got your spell on me baby, got your spell on me baby
                 Dm7                                   Gm
Got your spell on me baby turnin' my heart into stone
  Dm7                   A7                       Dm
I need you so bad magic woman I can't leave you alone
