Evil Ways

You've got to change, your evil ways....ba..by.
Gm     C      Gm     C
before I stop, loving you.
C            Gm   C   Gm  C
You've go to change...ba..by.
Gm        C            Gm      C
And every word, that I say, is true.
C             Gm           C           Gm     C
You've got me running, and hiding, all over town.
C             Gm           C
You've got me sneaking and peeping,
    Gm          C
and running you down.

C            D     D                     Gm    (C Gm)
this cant go on... Lord knows you got to change


C           Gm     C   Gm
When I come home...ba..by.
Gm          C           Gm       C
My house is dark and my pots are cold.
C              Gm      C   Gm C
You're hanging round...ba..by.
Gm            C         Gm        C
With Jean and Joan, and who knows who.
C           Gm       C           Gm       C
I'm getting tired of waiting and fooling around,
C             Gm        C             Gm          C      
I'll find somebody, who won't make me feel like a clown...

When I come calling and asking, all over town,

you've got me searching and looking..you've made the rounds.
