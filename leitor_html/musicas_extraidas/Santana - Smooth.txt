Smooth
Santana

Am   F  E  (x4)

           Am       F E
Man it's a hot one
E7                         Am         F E
Like seven inches from the midday sun
             E7             Dm7  Dm7/C     Dm7/B
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
E7               Am  F E
But you stay so cool
E7      Am   F E           E7          Am  F E
My munequita,   my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
         E7         Dm7   Dm7/C  Dm7/B
Your my reason for reason
     E7         Am     F E
The step in my groove

E7         Am        F           E    E7
And if you say this life ain't good enough
         Am      F        E       E7
I would give my world to lift you up
         Am        F      E      E7         Dm7  Dm7/C  Dm7/B
I could change my life to better suit your mood
G                Bsus4/F# Bsus4 E7#9
Cause you're so smooth
         Am           F     E          E7
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
                 Am          F           E  E7
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
   Am                F             E       E7
You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
Dm7                         E7
Gimme your heart, make it real
                     Am
Or else forget about it

Am   F  E  

              Am        F E
I'll tell you one thing
E7                              Am           F E
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
             E7             Dm7  Dm7/C       Dm7/B
In every breath and every word,  I hear your name
E7         Am  F E
calling me out
E7           Am      F E             E7               Am    F E
Out from the barrio,     you hear my rhythm from your radio
         E7                 Dm7   Dm7/C       Dm7/B
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
E7          Am     F E
Turning you round     and round

E7         Am        F         E    E7
And if you say this life ain't good enough
         Am      F        E       E7
I would give my world to lift you up
         Am        F      E      E7         Dm7  Dm7/C  Dm7/B
I could change my life to better suit your mood
