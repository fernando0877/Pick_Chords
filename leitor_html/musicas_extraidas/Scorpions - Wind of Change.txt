Wind of Change
Scorpions

C                Dm                C 
 I folow the Moskva, Down to Gorky Park 
                  Dm      Am  G  
 Listening to the wind of change 

 C                Dm                      C 
 An August summer night, Soldiers passing by 
                  Dm      Am  G 
 Listening to the wind of change

Assobio:
F   Dm   F   Dm

C                      Dm              C 
 The world is closing in, Did you ever think 
                     Dm          Am G    
 That we could be so close, like brothers

C                    Dm                    C 
 The future's in the air, I can feel it everywhere 
                  Dm      Am   G 
 Blowing with the wind of change  
  
C    G          Dm           G 
Take me, to the magic of the moment 
     C     G 
On a glory night 
          Dm            G      
Where the children, of tomorrow
       Am   F        G        C 
dream away,   in the wind of change 

G                  Dm                  C 
 Walking down the street, Distant memories 
                   Dm         Am   G 
 Are buried in the past, foreeeeeeever      
 
C                Dm                C 
 I folow the Moskva, Down to Gorky Park 
                  Dm      Am  G 
 Listening to the wind of change 
 
C    G         Dm            G 
Take me to the magic, of the moment 
     C     G 
On a glory night 
          Dm            G
Where the children of tomorrow 
       Am   F        G        C 
share their dreams, With you and me (2x)
 
Am                          G                         Am                                   
 The wind of change, Blows straight into the face of time 
                            G 
 Like a stormwind that will ring 
                               C 
 The freedom bell For peace of mind 
                    Dm                             E      
 Let your balalaika sing, What my guitar wants to say
