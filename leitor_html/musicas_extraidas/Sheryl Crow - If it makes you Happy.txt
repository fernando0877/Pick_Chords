If it makes you Happy
Sheryl Crow

          G    C/G
I've been long, a long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos,
                              C
And drank til I was thirsty again

We went searching through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and a pen

C                      D
Well, O.K. I made this up
  C                             D
I promised you I'd never give up

                Am    C
If it makes you happy
                 G   D
It can't be that bad
                Am    C
If it makes you happy

Then why the hell are you so, 

sad... You get down, real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
                             C
Well who hasn't been there before ?

I come round, around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you french toast again

Well, O.K. I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home


We've been far far  away from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos
And everywhere in between

Well, O.K. we get along
So what if right now everything's wrong ?
