 Hello darkness, my old friend,
             /              D9
I've come to talk with you again,
          F             A#    F
Because a vision softly-y creeping,
         F             A#      F
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
        A#               /             F
And the visions that was planted in my brain,
  A#    F     Dm F            C        D9
still remains,     Within the sound of silence

            /                C
In restless dreams I walked alone
        /                 Dm
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
           /        A#     F
Neath the halo of a stree-t’lamp,
            /             A#       F
I turned my collar to the cold and damp

         A#
When my eyes were stabbed,
       /                 F                     /    Dm  F
by the flash of the neon light, That split the night    
                 C        Dm
And touched the sound of silence

Dm           /             C
  And in the naked light I saw
                            Dm
Ten thousand people, maybe more
                  A#         F
People talking, without speaking,
F                     A#      F
  People hearning, without listening

       /        A#         /             F
People writing songs, that voices never share
    /      Dm                    C        Dm
And no one dare,     Disturb the sound of silence

           F            C
Fools said I, "You dont know"
                      Dm
Silence like a cancer grows
                             A#         F
Hear my words, that I, might head teach you,
                            A#          F
Take my arms, that, I might head, reach you

       A#                           F    Dm
But my words, like silent raindrops fell,
      F            C        D9
And echoed, In the walls of silence

        /                C
And the people bowed and prayed
                     Dm
To the neon god they made

        F               A#     F
And the sing, flashe-d its warning,
                         A#    F
In the words, that is wa-as forming

                       A#
And the sign said The words of the prophets
                          F
Are written on the subway walls
             F     Dm
And tenement’halls 
    F                 C        Dm
And whispered in, the sound of silence.
