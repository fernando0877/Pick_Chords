The boxer
Simon and Garfunkel

C
I am just a poor boy. 
                         Am
Though my story's seldom told, 
       G
I have squandered my resistance 
      G7                               C
For a pocket full of mumbles, Such are promises 

              Am
 All lies and jest 
        G                 F
Still a man hears what he wants to hear 
                   C     G        C
And disregards the rest. uhmmmm  mmmm

       C
When I left my home , And my family, 
                    Am
I was no more than a boy 
       G
In the company of strangers 
       G7
In the quiet of the railway station, 
C
Running scared, 
        Am
 Laying low, 
        G              F
Seeking out the poorer quarters 
                        C
Where the ragged people go 
        G
Looking for the places 
F    Em   Dm    C
Only they would know 

       Am            Em                     Am
Lie-la-lie,  Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie lie-la-lie,  
       F                G               C
Lie-la-lie la la la la, Lie la la la la lie

Asking only workman's wages 
                     Am
I come looking for a job, 
             G
But I get no offers, 
       G7
Just a come-on from the whores 
           C
On Seventh Avenue 
        Am
 I do declare, 
           G                F
There were times when I was so lonesome 
                    C
I took some comfort there. 
       G                  C
Ooo-la-la la-la la-la 

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes 
                  Am
And wishing I was gone, 
      G
Going home 
           G7
 Where the New York City winters 
       C
Aren't bleeding me, 
         Em   Am
 Leading me - e, 
       G        C
 Going home. 

       C
In the clearing stands a boxer, 
                     Am
And a fighter by his trade 
       G
And he carries the reminders 
   G7
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down 
                     
Or cut him till he cried out 
                     Am
In his anger and his shame, 
 
      G             F
"I am leaving, I am leaving." 
                        C     G  G7  C
But the fighter still remains
