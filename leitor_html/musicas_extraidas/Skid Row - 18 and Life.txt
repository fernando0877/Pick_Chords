Ricky was a young boy, he had a heart of stone.
C#m        B                A              B
Lived 9 to 5 and worked his fingers to the bone.
C#m         B            C#m             B
Just barely out of school, came from the edge of town.
C#m           B              A                    B
Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down.

A                   F# 
He had no money, ooh, no good at home.
   G#                            F#  G# A                B
He walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone

C#m          A                 E            B
Eighteen and life you got it.  Eighteen and life you know.
C#m           A              E            B
Your crime is time and it's, eighteen and life to go.
C#m          A                 E            B
Eighteen and life you got it.  Eighteen and life you know.
C#m           A              E            B       C#m  B C#m B C#m B A B
Your crime is time and it's, eighteen and life to go.

C#m     B               C#m                B
Tequila in his heartbeat, his veins burned gasoline.
C#m         B             A             B
It kept his motor running, but it never kept him clean.
C#m         B              C#m           B
They say he loved adventure, Ricky's the wild one.
C#m        B             A                B
He married trouble had a courtship with a gun.

A                            F#
Bang, bang shoot 'em up, the party never ends.
    G#                    F#   G#  A                  B
You can't think of dying when that bottle's your best friend.

And now it's...

E                             B
"Accidents will happen", they all heard Ricky say.
  A                                     B                  C#m
He fired his six-shot to the wind, that child blew a child away.
