I Remember You
Skid Row

G                       C9   
Woke up to the sound of pouring rain 
G                                C9   
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you 
G                                   C9   
And all the tears you cried, that called my name 
D                      C
And when you needed me I came through 

G                         C9   
I paint a picture of the days gone by 
G                                   C9   
When love went blind and you would make me see 
G                     C9   
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes 
D                         C
So that I knew you were there for me 
D                          C
Time after time you were there for me 

G                  D
Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand 
Em                        C    D      G
Love letters in the sand, I remember you 
                            D
Through the sleepless nights and every endless day 
Em                      C    D      G       C    G    C
I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you 

G                             C9   
We spend the summer with the top rolled down 
G                       C9   
Wished ever after would be like this 
G                             C9   
You said I love you babe, without a sound 
D                            C
I said I'd give my life for just one kiss 
D                            C
I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss (refr√£o)

Am
We've had our share of hard times 
Em
But that's the price we paid 
Am                             D
And through it all we kept the promise that we made 

I swear you'll never be lonely 

G                       C9      
Woke up to the sound of pouring rain 
G             C9   
Washed away a dream of you 
G                           C9   
But nothing else could ever take you away 
D                          C
'Cause you'll always be my dream come true 
D              C
Oh my darling, I love you 

G                  D
Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand 
Em                        C    D      G
Love letters in the sand, I remember you 
                            D
Through the sleepless nights and every endless day 
Em                      C    D      G
I'd wanna hear you say, I remember you 


G                  D
Remember yesterday, walking hand in hand 
Em                        C    D      G
Love letters in the sand, I remember you 
                            D
Through the sleepless nights and every endless day 
Em                      C    D      C    D      G
I'd wanna hear you say, I remember, I remember you

D     Em     C
G     D     Em     C
G     C9        G     C9   
Em     G
