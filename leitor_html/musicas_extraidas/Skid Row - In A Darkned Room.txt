In A Darkned Room
Skid Row

(solo come√ßa em A4)
Em7   C9    D/F#    C9

     Em7                       C9
In a darkened room, Beyond the reach, of god's faith
         D                    C9
Lies the wounded, shattered remains, of a love betrayed

        Em7             C9
And the innocence, Of a child is bought and sold
       D/F#
In the name of the damned
                C9
The rage of the angels, left silent and cold

D            C9                 Em7       D      C9
  Forgive me please, For what I know, not what I do
D           Am               Em7    D/F#    D
  How can I keep inside, The hurt I know is true

------------
                       C9                      Em7
oooh Tell me, when the kiss, Of love becomes a lie
                        G                 D              
That bears the scars of sin, too deep, To hide behind 

     C9                    Em7
this fear, of running unto you
                    D                                 Em7
Please let there be liiiii-i-iiiight... In a darkened room

Em7   C9    D/F#    C9

        Em7                      C9
All the precious time, Have been put to rest again
          D
And the smile of a dawn,
               C9
Brings tainted lust, singing my requiem

(voz )
       Em7                   C9
Can I face the day, When I'm tortured in my trust
             D
And watch it, crystalize
        C9
While my salvation, has crumble to dust

D         C9                Em7     D         C9
Why can I steer the ship, Before it hits the storm
D          Am                 Em7       D/F#      D     
I've fallen to the sea, But still I can swim for shore
