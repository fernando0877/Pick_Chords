E7+     E   A       E7+     E
A                          E7+     E
  Shakedown nineteen seven nine,
A                          E7+     E
  Cool kids never have the time.
    A                            F#m7
On a live wire right up off the street
        B        E7+     E
You and I should meet.

A                         E7+     E
  Junebug skipping like a stone
A                                E7+     E
  With headlights pointed at the dawn.
A                                 F#m7      B
  We were sure we'd never see, An end to it all

    E       E7+   A7+                        E
And I don't even  care to shake these zipper blues,
    E7+      A7+                            E
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
   E7+    A7+                       F#m7          B       E7+   E
To dust I guess, Forgotten and absorbed, into the earth below

A                                 E7+     E
  Double cross the vacant and the bored,
A                                       E7+     E
  They're not sure just what we have in store.
A                        F#m7         A
  Morphine city slippin' dues down to see

     E        E7+   A7+                    E
That we don't even  care as restless as we are,
   E7+      A7+                            E
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts.
    E7+      A7+                B
And poured cement, Lamented and assured.

                  C#m     A
To the lights and towns below,
B               C#m      A
Faster than the speed of sound,
B              C#m          A    F#m7      B        E7+     E
Faster than we thought we'd go beneath the sound of hope.

A                        E7+     E
  Justine never knew the rules,
A                               E7+     E
  Hung down with the freaks and ghouls.
    A                      E7+     E
No a-pologies ever need be made,
A                            F#m7       B
  I know you better than you fake it to see (refr√£o)

A                                 E7+     E
  The street heats the urgency of now.
A                            E
  As you see there's no one around
