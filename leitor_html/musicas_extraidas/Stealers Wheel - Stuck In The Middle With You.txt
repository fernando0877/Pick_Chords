Stuck In The Middle With You
Stealers Wheel

D
Well I don't know why I came here tonight
D
I got the feeling that something ain't right
        G7
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
        D
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs
A                         C            
Clowns to the left of me, Jokers to the right,
        D
 here I am, Stuck in the middle with you
     D
 Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you

    D
And I'm wondering what it is I should do
        G7
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face
          D
Losing control, I'm all over the place
A                         C            
Clowns to the left of me, Jokers to the right,
        D
 here I am, Stuck in the middle with you

           G7
Well you started out with nothing 
                                    D
and you're proud that you're a Self made man
         G7
And your friends, they all come crawlin,
                             D         A7
slap you on the back and say Please... Please

D
Trying to make some sense of it all
          D
But I can see that it makes no sense at all
      G7
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor
        D
I don't think that I can take anymore
A                         C            
Clowns to the left of me, Jokers to the right,
        D
 here I am, Stuck in the middle with you
