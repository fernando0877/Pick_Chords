Do It Again
Steely Dan

|Am7  Bm7 |  C  Bm7 | Em 


       Em
In the mor-nin you go gunnin', For the man, who stole your water
Em
And you fire, till he is done-in, But they catch you at the border
Em
And the mourners are all sangin', As they drag you by your feet
Em
But the hangman isn't hangin', And they put you on the street

       Am7   Bm7    C      Bm7
You go back, Jack,  do it again
Em
  Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
       Am7   Bm7   C      Bm7
You go back, Jack, do it again

         Em
When you know she's no high climber, Then you find your only friend
Em
In a room with your two timer, And you're sure you're near the end
Em
Then you love a little wild-one, And she brings you only sorrow
Em
All the time you know she's smilin', You'll be on your knees tomorrow, yeah

       Am7   Bm7    C      Bm7
You go back, Jack,  do it again
Em
  Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
       Am7   Bm7   C      Bm7
You go back, Jack, do it again

        Em
Now you swear and kick and beg us, That you're not a gamblin' man
Em
Then you find you're back in Vegas, With a handle in your hand
Em
Your black cards, can make you money, So you hide them when you're able
Em
In the land, of milk and honey, You must put them on the table,
