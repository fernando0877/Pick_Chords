Born To Be Wild
Steppenwolf


Em                    A7 G 
Get your motor running
Head out, on the highway
Looking for adventure, 
In whatever, comes our way

G      A              Em
  Yeah darling, gonna make it happen
Take the world, in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns, at once and 
explode into space

Em                         A7 G 
I like, smoke and, lightning, 
Heavy metal thunder
Racing in the wind, 
And the feeling that I'm tunder

Refr√£o

Em
Like a true nature's child
        G
We were born, born to be wild
       A7            G              Em
We can climb so high, I never wanna die

Em         G    A   G     Em
Born to be wiiiiiiiiiiiiiild
