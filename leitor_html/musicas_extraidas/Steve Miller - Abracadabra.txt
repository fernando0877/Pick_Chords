Abracadabra
Steve Miller

Am            Dm              E7#9                 Am
 I heat up; I can't cool down; you got me spinnin' round and round.
Am                    Dm            E7#9             Am
 Round and round, and round it goes; where it stops, nobody knows.

Am              Dm           E7#9              Am
 Every time you call my name, I heat up like a burnin' flame.
Am             Dm             E7#9
 Burnin' flame full of desire; kiss me baby, let the fire get higher.

   Am          Dm    E7#9                     Am
Ab-ra, abra-ca-dabra, I want to reach out and grab ya.
   Am          Dm     E7#9   Am
Ab-ra, abra-ca-dabra, abraca-dabra.

Am                    Dm           E7#9                    Am
 You make me hot, you make me sigh, you make me laugh, you make me cry.
Am               Dm            E7#9                 Am
 Keep me burnin' for your love, with the touch of a velvet glove.

   Am          Dm    E7#9                     Am
Ab-ra, abra-ca-dabra, I want to reach out and grab ya.
   Am          Dm     E7#9   Am
Ab-ra, abra-ca-dabra, abraca-dabra.

Am                Dm             E7#9                 Am
 I feel the magic in your caress, I feel magic when I touch your dress.
Am               Dm               E7#9                   Am
 Silk and satin, leather and lace, black panties with an angels face.

Am           Dm           E7#9              Am
 I see magic in your eyes, I hear the magic in your sighs.
Am                           Dm
 Just when I think I'm gonna get away,
E7#9                     Am
 I hear those words that you always say;...

   Am          Dm    E7#9                     Am
Ab-ra, abra-ca-dabra, I want to reach out and grab ya.
   Am          Dm     E7#9   Am
Ab-ra, abra-ca-dabra, abraca-dabra.

Am              Dm           E7#9              Am
 Every time you call my name, I heat up like a burnin' flame.
Am             Dm             E7#9
 Burnin' flame full of desire; kiss me baby, let the fire get higher.

 I heat up, I cant cool down, my situation goes round and round.
I heat up, I cant cool down, my situation goes round and round.
I heat up, I cant cool down, my situation goes round and round.
