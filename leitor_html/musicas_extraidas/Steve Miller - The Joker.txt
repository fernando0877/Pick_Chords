  Some people call me the space cowboy
  Some call me the gangster of love
  Some people call me Maurice
  Cause I speak of the pompitous of love

  People talk about me, baby
  Say I'm doing you wrong, doing you wrong
  Don't you worry baby
  Cause I'm right here, right here, 
  right here, right here at home

               G          C
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner
      G               C
I'm a lover And I'm a sinner
          C            D    C
I play my music in the suuuuuun
       G           C            G        C
I'm a joker,I'm a smoker, I'm a midnight toker
         C             D   C
I get my lovin' on the run

You're the cutest thing that I ever did see
I really love your peaches Want to shake your tree
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time
Ooo-eee baby, I'll sure show you a good time
