Fields Of Gold
Sting

         Bm                  G
You'll remember me, when the west wind moves
                   D
Upon the fields of barley
         Bm                  G      D
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
      G/B     A         Bm7  /  G D
As we walk in fields of gold

       Bm                     G
So she took her love, for to gaze awhile
                   D
Upon the fields of barley
       Bm                      G         D
In his arms she fell, as her hair came down
 G/B      A             D
Among the fields of gold

         Bm                     G
Will you stay with me, will you be my love
                     D
Among the fields of barley
         Bm                  G       D
We'll forget the sun, in his jealous sky
      G/B    A         Bm7 / G D
As we lie in fields of gold

        Bm                     G
See the west wind move, like a lover so
                   D
Upon the fields of barley
         Bm                  G         D
Feel her body rise, when you kiss her mouth
 G/B      A           D
Among the fields of gold

G               D
  I never made promises lightly
G                      D
  And there have been, some that I've broken
G                     D
   But I swear in the days still left
      G/B     A          D
We'll walk in fields of gold
      G/B     A          D
We'll walk in fields of gold

      Bm                            G
Many years have passed, since those summer days
                      D
Among the fields of barley
        Bm                   G        D
See the children run, as the sun goes down
     G/B  A          D
Among the fields of gold

         Bm                  G
You'll remember me, when the west wind moves
                   D
Upon the fields of barley
         Bm                  G       D
You can tell the sun, in his jealous sky

         G/B       A          D
When we walked in fields of gold (3x)
