Fragile
Sting

faz assobio ao inves de arranjo

Em                  
  If blood will flow
     Am7
when flesh and steel are one 
B7                          Em 
Drying in the colour of the evening sun

           Em7  
Tomorrow's rain
             Am7 
will wash the stains away
    B7                                  Em 
But something in our minds will always stay

   Em7 
Perhaps this final act was meant 
   Am7 
To clinch a lifetime's argument 
     B7 
That nothing comes from violence

    Em 
and nothing ever could 
    Em7                             Am7 
For all those born beneath an angry star 
     B7                            Em 
Lest we forget how fragile we are 

C            B7 
On and on the rain will fall 
     Em 
Like tears from a star, Like tears from a star

Am            B7 
On and on the rain will say 
    Em 
How fragile we are, How fragile we are
