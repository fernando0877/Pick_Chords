Interstate love song
Stone Temple Pilots

C#m  E  A9  G#4(7) G#  A   E

C#m7        Cm5+                B9(6)               
Waiting on a Sunday afternoon for what I read 
    Bbm7(b5)       A9     E E4 E
between the lines.   Your lies.
  C#m7          Cm5+                    B9(6)        
Feelin' like a hand in rusted shame. So do you laugh 
           Bbm7(b5)    A9    E E4 E
or does it cry?     Reply?


           C#m          E                   A9       
          Leavin' on a southern train only yesterday 
   G#4(7) G#   A                 E
you lied.     Promises of what I seemed to be
                A9                G#4(7) G#     A     
          Only watched the time go by.         All of 
                  E
these things you said to me



  C#m7           Cm5+                      B9(6)    
Breathing is the hardest thing to do. With all I've 
                    Bbm7(b5)
said and all that's dead for you
     A9       E  E4 E      A9     E E4 E    E E4(6) 
You lied...             Goodbye.
