Rivers of Babylon
Sublime

                   G
  By the Rivers of Babylon, 
  where he sat down
               D    
  And there he wept
                     G
  When he remembered Zion

                     
  Oh from the wicked,
  G
  carry us away (from) captivity
  C                    G 
  Require from us this song
                                   
  How can we sing, King Alpha's song
       D       G
  in a strange land?

  G                         D
  So let the words of our mouth
  G                         D
  And a meditation of our hearts
  G                      D
  Be acceptable in thy sight
           G
  Oh - verai!
