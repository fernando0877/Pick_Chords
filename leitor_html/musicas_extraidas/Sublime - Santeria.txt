Santeria
Sublime

E, G# , C#m , B 
I dont practice santeria, I aint got no crystal ball
Well, I had a million dollars, but I, I'd spend it all

If I could find that heina, And that Sancho that shes found
Well, I'd pop a cap in Sancho and Id slap her down

/A, B, E, C#m /
What I really wanna know, my baby
What I really wanna say, I cant define
Well, its love that I need oh
My soul will have to

/E, G# , C#m , B /
Wait til I get back, Find a heina of my own
Daddys gonna love one and all
I feel the break, feel the break, feel the break
And I gotta, live it up, ohh, yeah, huh
Well, I swear that I

/A, B, E, C#m /
What I really wanna know, oh, baby
What I really wanna say, I cant define
That love make it go, My soul will have to

Oh, what I really wanna say, My baby
What I really wanna say, Is Ive got mine
And Ill make it, Yes, Im comin up
Tell Sanchito that if he knows

solo

/ E, G# , C#m , B /
What is good for him, Hed best go run and hide
Daddys got a new .45
And I wont think twice to stick
That barrel, straight down Sanchos throat
Believe me when I say
That I got something for his punk ass

/ A, B, E, C#m /
What I really wanna know, my baby, oooh
What I really wanna say is theres just one
Way back and Ill make it, yeah
My soul will have to wait
