Alright
Supergrass

        D
We are young, we run green,

Keep our teeth, nice and clean
          Em                             D
See our friends, see the sights, feel alright...

        D
We wake up, we go out,

Smoke a fag, put it out,
          Em                            D
See our friend, see the sights, feel alright...

Are we like you?

I can't be sure,

Of the scene, as she turns,
        A7
We are strange in our worlds

                D
despite, We are young, We get by,

Can't go mad, ain't got time,
       Em                             D
Sleep around, if we like, but we're alright...

         D
Got some cash, got some wheels,

Took it out, 'cross the fields,
        Em                        D
Lost control, hit a wall, we're alright...
