I said "Far out, What a day, a year, a life it is"
Ab  Bb             Gm                          C
You know, Well you know, you had, it coming to you,

If I could see something
You can see anything you want boy

If I could be someone-
You can be anyone, celebrate boy.

If I could do something-

Take a dream on a Sunday

Take a life, take a holiday
