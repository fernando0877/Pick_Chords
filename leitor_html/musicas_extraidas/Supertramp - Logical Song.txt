  Am                              F7+         Em7
When I was young, it seemed that life, was so wonderful
   G                   F7+        F#dim
A miracle, ohnit was beautiful, magical
             Am                                  F7+        Em7
And all the birds in the trees, well, they'd be singing so happily
     G              F7+       F#dim
Oh joyfully, oh playfully, watching me


               Am                        F7+       Em7
But then they sent me away, to teach me how to be sensible
G              F7+       F#dim
Logical, oh responsible, practical
               Am                              F7+      Em7
And then they showed me a world, where I could be, so dependable
   G                F7+      F#dim
Oh clinical, oh intellectual, cynical

          C                             Am6/C
There are times, when all the world's asleep
                       F7+                    Bb Bb/A Bb/G  Bb/F
The questions run too deep for such a simple man            
            C                                D/C
Won't you please, please tell me, what we've learned
                    F7+                           Bb Bb/A Bb/G  Bb/F
I know, it sounds absurd, but please tell me who I am           


            Am                               F7+           Em7
I said, now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical
   G             F7+       F#dim
A liberal, oh, fanatical, criminal
               Am                              F7+           Em7
Oh, won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're acceptable
    G                F7+         F#dim
Respectable, oh, presentable, a vegetable

Oh, take, take, take it, yeah
