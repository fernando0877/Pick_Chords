F7+                     G6
How can I be sure, when your intrusion’s my illusion? 
F7+                     G6
How can I be sure? when all the time you changed my mind 
F7+                        Am/D 
I asked for more and more, How can I be sure? 

                        A        G             D      
When you don't give me love, you give me, Pale Shelter
C                 A         G            D    
You don't give me love, you give me cold hands
    C           A       G       D    C
And I, can't operate on,   this failure      
                    A    G 
When all, I want to be is,
D6             C6      B7    B7
Completely in commaaaaaaaaaaand   

F7+                     G6
How can I be sure, for all you say you keep me waiting
F7+                     G6
How can I be sure, when all you do is see me through 
  F7+                      Am/D 
I asked for more and more, How can I be sure?

F7+                          G6
I've been here before, there is no why, no need to try, 
F7+                           G6
I thought you had it all, I'm calling you, I'm calling you, 
  F7+                    Am/D                F7+  Am/D  C  G
I ask for more and more, How can I be sure?

                  F7+                     Am/D    C     G
You don't give me love, You don't give me love (4x)
