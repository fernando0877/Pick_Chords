Em                            C7+/G
Shout, Shout, let it all out. These are the things I can do without
     A9                           Em
Come on, I'm talking to you, come on (2x)

   G                                    A9
In violent times, you shouldn't have to sell your soul
   G                                   A9
In black and white, they really really ought to know
      G                                    A9
Those one track minds, that took you for a working boy
     G                                   A9
Kiss them goodbye, you shouldn't have to jump for joy (You shouldn't have to

Em                            C7+/G
Shout, Shout, let it all out. These are the things I can do without
     A9                           Em
Come on, I'm talking to you, come on
 
     G                                A9
They gave you life, and in return you gave them hell
   G                              A9
As cold as ice, I hope we live to tell the tale (I hope we live to...)

Em                            C7+/G
Shout, Shout, let it all out. These are the things I can do without
     A9                           Em
Come on, I'm talking to you, come on (2x)

G                       A9
And when you've taken down your guard
G                                               A9
If I could change your mind, I'd really love to break your heart (I'd really love to...)
