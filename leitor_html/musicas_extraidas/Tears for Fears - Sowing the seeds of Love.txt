Tears for Fears

Gm7             F
High time we made a stand
    Eb7+                       C/D 
And shook up the views, of the common man
        Eb7+                   C/D 
And the love train, rides from coast to coast
Eb7+             C/D 
DJ's the man, we love the most

As the headline, says you're free to choose
        Eb7+                  C/D

I spy, tears in their eyes
     Eb7+                   C/D 
They look to the skies, for some kind of divine
Eb7+          C/D 
intervention, food goes to waste
