Pump Up The Jam
Technotronic

Cm
Pump, up the jam, Pump it up
While your feet,  are stompin
And the jam, is pumpin, Look here the crowd, is jumpin'

Pump it up, a little more
Get the party, gonna on the dance floor
See, cause thats, where the party
s`at And you find out it, if you do that

I want, a plaace, to stay
Get your booty, on the floor, toniight
Make my day

Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
