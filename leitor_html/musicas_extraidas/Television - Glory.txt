Glory
Television

I was out, stumblin' in the rain
Staring at your lips so red
You said "Blah blah blah
Got a pillow stuck in my head"
How could I argue with a mirror
She looked at me, yes I hear her
When I see the glory
I ain't got no worries
When I see the glory
I ain't got no worries

said there's a halo on that truck
Won't you please get it for me?
I said of course my little swan
If ever and ever you adore me
She got mad, she set it too steep
Puts on her boxing gloves and went to sleep
When I see the glory
I ain't got no worries
When I see the glory
I ain't got no worries
