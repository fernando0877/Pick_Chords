The Weight
The Band

I pulled into Nazareth, was feeling about half past dead
I just need some place, where I can lay my head
Hey, mister, can you tell me, where a man might find a bed?
He just grinned and shook my hand, no was all he said

A      E/G#     D
Take a load off Fanny, 
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny.. And (and)(and) 
                          A E/G# F#m E D //
You put the load right on me

I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw, Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side
I said Hey Carmen, come on let's go downtown
She said, I gotta go but my friend can stick around

Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say
It's just ol' Luke and, Luke's waiting on the Judgment Day
Well, Luke, my friend, what about young AnnaLee?
He said, Do me a favor son, won't you stay & keep AnnaLee company?

Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog
He said, I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog
I said, Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man
He said, That's okay boy, won't you feed him when you can

Catch a cannon ball now to take me down the line
My bag is sinking low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone
