Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
         D                 G                A
I'm not sleepy, and there, ain't place I'm going to.

In the jingle jangle, morning, I'll come following you.

 G            A              D              G
Take me on a trip upon, your magic swirlin' ship,
       D                  G      
ohh My senses, have been stripped,
       D                    G
ohh my hands can't feel to grip,
   D                G
My toes too numb to step
      D           G                A
wait only for, my boot heels to be wandering

      G           A           D            G
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
  D           G               D                G
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
   Em            A
I promise to go under it

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
          D               G               A
I'm not sleepy and there ain't place I'm going to.

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
