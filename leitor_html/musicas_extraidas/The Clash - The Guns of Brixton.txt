The Guns of Brixton
The Clash

F#m Bm  F#m Bm  G Bm  G Bm
          F#m                Bm  
When they kick at your front door
F#m           Bm  
How you gonna come?
          G             Bm  
With your hands on your head
          G               Bm
Or on the trigger of your gun
          F#m                Bm  
When the law break in
F#m           Bm
How you gonna go?
  G                  Bm  
Shot down on the pavement
      G               Bm
Or waiting on death row

        F#m 
You can crush us
        Bm
You can bruise us
           F#m            Bm
But you'll have to answer to
G  Bm          G      Bm
Oh-the guns of Brixton

      F#m            Bm  
The money feels good
          F#m                Bm  
And your life you like it well
      G                  Bm   
But surely your time will come
     G                  Bm  
As in heaven, as in hell
      F#m              Bm  
You see, he feels like Ivan
       F#m                Bm 
Born under the Brixton sun
      G                  Bm 
His game is called survival
         G                      Bm 
At the end of the harder they come
      F#m            Bm  
You know it means no mercy
        F#m              Bm  
They caught him with a gun
      G                  Bm 
No need for the Black Maria
      G                  Bm 
Goodbye to the Brixton sun

        F#m 
You can crush us
        Bm
You can bruise us
           F#m            Bm
