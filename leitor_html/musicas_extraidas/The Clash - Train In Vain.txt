D A/C# A A

                 D A/C# A            D A/C# A
You say you stand         by your man
              D A/C# A                    D A/C# A
Tell me something    I don't understand
             D                      Bm
You said you loved me, and that's a fact

              D A/C# A                      D A/C# A
The you left me,     said you felt trapped
           D                         A
Well, some things, you can't explain away
        Bm                            D
But the heartache's, with me till this day

                       D A/C# A             D A/C# A
You didn't stand by me......... No, not at all
                      D A/C# A      D A/C# A
You didn't stand by me....... No way


All the times, when we were close
I'll remember, these things the most
      D                            Bm
I see all, my dreams come tumblin' down

I can't be happy, without you around
     D                         A
So alone, I keep the wolves at bay
            Bm                   D
And there's only one thing I can say

                       D A/C# A             D A/C# A
You didn't stand by me......... No, not at all
                      D A/C# A      D A/C# A
You didn't stand by me....... No way

           A     F#m  Bm                  D A/C# A  D A/C# A
You must expla-a-a-ain   why this must be
        A    F#m Bm                     D A/C# A  D A/C# A
Did you li-i-i-ie  when you spoke to me?

                    D A/C# A                D A/C# A
Did you stand be me?      No, not at all
Now I got a job, but it don't pay

I need new clothes, I need somewhere to stay
But without all,  of these things I can do

But without your love, I won't make it through
But you don't understand, my point of view
I suppose there nothing I can do
