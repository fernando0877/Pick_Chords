E  A9  B7

voz na 3a aguda:
E      A9                    B7
Oh my life is changing everyday
                E
Every possible way
            A9                              B7
And oh, my dreams, it's never quite as it seems
                   E
Never quite as it seems

                           A9
I know I felt like this before
                            B7
But now I'm feeling it even more
                     E
Because it came from you

                   A9
Then I open up and see
                           B7
The person falling here is me
                    E  ( G  C9  G  C9  D )
A different way to be

E       A                     B
I want more, impossible to ignore
                 E
Impossible to ignore
              A9                     B7
They'll come true, impossible not to do
                   E
Impossible not to do

                   A9
Now I tell you openly
                                B7
You have my heart so don't hurt me
                    E
For what I couldn't find

                 A9
Tota-lly amazing mind
                        B7
So understanding and so kind
                     E
You're everything to me

      A9                    B7
Oh my life is changing everyday
                E
Every possible way
          A9                             B
Though my dreams, it's never quite as it seems
                         E
'Cause you're a dream to me, Dream to me
