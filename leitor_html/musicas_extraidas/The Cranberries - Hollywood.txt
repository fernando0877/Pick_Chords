Hollywood
The Cranberries

Em         C             Am          Em
I've got a picture in my head, In my head
Em          C             Am             Em
It's me and you we are in bed, We are in bed
Em            C                 Am                Em
You've always been there when I called, When I called
Em            C                  Am
You've always been there most of all, all, all, all

Em      C        Am
This is not Hollywood, Like I understood
Em C        Am
Is not Hollywood, Like, like, like (2x)

     Em        C       Am
Run away, run away, Is anybody there? (2x)
     Em        C         Am
get away, get away, get away, away (2x)
Ooooooo OOOOooo OOOO

Em            C             Am         Em
  I've got a picture in my room, In my room
Em        C               Am               Em
 I will return there I presume, It will be soon
Em           C        Am             Em
The greatest irony of all, Shoot the wall
Em           C             Am
 It's not so glamourous at all, all, all
