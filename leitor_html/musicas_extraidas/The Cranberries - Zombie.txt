Em  C7M  G6  D6(9)/F#

Em          C7M
   Another head hangs lowly
  G6             D9(11)/F#  Em
Child is slowly taken
                  C7M
And the violence caused such silence
  G6           D9(11)/F#
Who are we mistaken?

             Em
But you see,    it's not me
            C7M
It's not my     family
              G6
In your head,    in your head
              D9(11)/F#
They are fighting

                 Em
With their tanks    and their bombs
                 C7M
And their bombs,     and their guns
              G6
In your head,     in your head
            D/F#
They are crying

         Em            C7M
In your head, in your head
        G6                D6(9)/F#
Zombie,    zombie, zombie
                Em            C7M
What's in your head, in your head
        G6                D6(9)/F#
Zombie,    zombie, zombie

Em          C7M
   Another mother's breaking
 G6               D9(11)/F#  Em
Heart is taking over
                   C7M
When the violence causes silence
 G6            D9(11)/F#
We must be mistaken

          Em
It's the same old theme
         C7M
Since nineteen-sixteen
              G6
In your head,    in your head
                   D9(11)/F#
They're still fighting

                 Em
With their tanks    and their bombs
                 C7M
And their bombs,     and their guns
              G6
In your head,    in your head
           D9(11)/F#
They are dying
