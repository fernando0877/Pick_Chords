A forest
The Cure


     Am            C F              D9
Come closer and see,   see into the trees
Am            C F            D9
find the girl,   while you can
     Am             C F            D9
Come closer and see,   see into the dark
     Am              C  F                 D9
just follow your eyes,   just follow your eyes

  Am            C  F            D9
I hear her voice,  calling my name
    Am            C        F     D9
the sound is deep,  in the dark
  Am             C       F           D9
I hear her voice,   and start to run
Am             C  F        D9
into the trees,   into the trees

Am              C F                    D9
Suddenly I stop,   but i know it's too late
    Am              C        F     D9
I'm lost in a forest,   all alone
    Am                  C        F              D9
The girl was never there,   it's always the same
    Am                     C     F                   D9
I'm running towards nothing,   again and again, and again

     B                     C
and again, and again, and again, and again, 
     F#                    C
and again, and again, and again, and again (2x)
