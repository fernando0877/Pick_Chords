Boys Don't Cry
The Cure

capo 1, G#
A                Bm 
I would say, I'm sorry
      C#m                    D
if I thought, that it, would change your mind
A                Bm
But I know that, this time I have,
C#m                 D7+
said too much been, to unkind

C#m         Bm             C#m                  Bm
  I try to laugh about it, Cover it all up with lies
C#m        Bm              C#m                 Bm
  I try to laugh about it, Hiding the tears in my eyes
     A    Bm    C#m  D7+ A    Bm     C#m  D
Cos' boys don't cry,     Boys don't cry

A                 Bm 
I would break down, at your feet and,
C#m              D
beg forgiveness, plead with you
A                 Bm 
But I know that, it's too late and
C#m              D
now there's nothing that I can do

A                 Bm 
I would tell you that I loved you
     C#m                      D
if I thought that, you would stay
A                 Bm 
But I know that it's no use that,
C#m              D
You've already gone away

E                 F#m  E                 F#m
  Misjudged your limit, Pushed you too far
E                F#m  
  Took you for granted,
   Bm                         E     D   C#m Bm 
I thought that you needed me, more, more, now

A                Bm 
I would do most, anything, To
C#m                 D
get you back, by my side
A           Bm
But I just, keep on laughing,
C#m                      D
Hiding the tears, in my eyes
