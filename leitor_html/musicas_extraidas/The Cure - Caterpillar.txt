The Cure

G     D
tu tu tu tu 

G                     D
flicka flicka flicka, here you are
cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
flowing in and filling up
my hopeless heart, oh never never go

C#m7(b5)      Bm
dust my lemon lies
with powder pink and sweet
The day I stop
This is the day you change
and fly away from me 

G
you flicker and you're beautiful
you glow inside my head
you hold me, hypnotized, i'm mesmerized
your flames the flames, that kiss me dead

C#m7(b5)      Bm
dust my lemon lies,
with powder pink and sweet
The day I stop, 
This is the day you change
                      Bbdim
and fly away from meeeee
