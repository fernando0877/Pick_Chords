Close to me
The Cure

B 
 I've waited hours for this, I've made myself so sick
   G#m                 F#
 I wish I'd stayed, Asleep today
B 
 I never thought this day would end
                               G#m
 I never thought tonight could ever be
      F#
 This close to me 

B 
 Just try to see in the dark, 
 Just try to make it work
G#m                    F#
 To feel the fear, before you're here
B 
 I make the shapes come much too close
                            G#m                 F#
 I pull my eyes out Hold my breath and wait, until I shake

E
 But if I had your faith (face)
                               B 
 Then I could make it safe and clean
E
 A-auu If only I was sure
                            B 
 That my head on door was a dream
