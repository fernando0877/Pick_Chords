The Cure

Gaita D
D                G              D                   A7
I don't care, if Monday's blue, Tuesday's grey, and Wednesday too
Bm                G                     D              A7
Thursday, I don't care, about you, It's Friday, I'm in love

D               G           D                  A7
Monday you, can fall apart, Tuesday Wednesday, break my heart
Bm                G                D             A7
Thursday, doesn't even start, It's Friday I'm in love

G        A7        Bm             G              
Saturday wait, And Sunday, always comes too late, 
    D            A7
But Friday never hesitate...

D                G              D                  A7
I don't care, if Mondays black, Tuesday Wednesday, heart attack
Bm              G                  D             A7 (solo)
Thursday, never looking back, It's Friday I'm in love

D              G               D                   A7
Monday you can hold your head, Tuesday Wednesday, stay in bed
   Bm                  G                   D             A7
Or Thursday, watch the walls instead, It's Friday I'm in love

Bm                 C                          D
 Dressed up to the eyes, it's a wonderful surprise
             A                      Bm
To see your shoes, and your spirits rise
                  C                              D
Throwing out your frown, and just smiling at the sound
                  A                          Bm
And as sleek as a shriek, spinning round and round

                  C                           D
Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight
           A                          Bm
To see you eat, in the middle of the night
                  C                       D
You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
            A
