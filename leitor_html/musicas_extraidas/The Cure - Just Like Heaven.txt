Just Like Heaven
The Cure

 A               E
"Show me how you do that trick
    Bm              D
The one that makes me scream" she said
     A                 E
"The one that makes me laugh" she said
    Bm            D
And threw her arms around my neck
 A               E
"Show me how you do it
      Bm          D
And I promise you I promise that
           A                E
I'll run away with you
          Bm              D
I'll run away with you"
A E Bm D (2x)

A                E 
Spinning on that dizzy edge
  Bm                D
I kissed her face and kissed her head
    A                   E               Bm
And dreamed of all the different ways I had
            D
To make her glow
A               E               Bm
"Why are you so far away?" she said
               D                     A            E
"Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you
            Bm           D
That I'm in love with you"

Twisting in the water

You're just like a dream
A E Bm D (2x)

A                  E
Daylight licked me into shape
  Bm             D
I must have been asleep for days
    A              E
And moving lips to breathe her name
  Bm         D
I opened up my eyes
    A             E
And found myself alone alone
 Bm         D
Alone above a raging sea
     A              E
That stole the only girl I loved
    Bm               D
And drowned her deep inside of me
