Killing an Arab
The Cure

Em
Standing on the beach, With a gun in my hand
Staring at the sea, Staring at the sand
Staring down the barrel, At the Arab on the ground
      Em
I can see his open mouth, But I hear no sound

     Am                       Em
I'm alive, I'm dead, I'm the stranger
Killing an Arab

I can turn and walk away, Or I can fire the gun
Staring at the sky, Staring at the sun
Whichever I chose, It amounts to the same
Absolutely nothing
I'm alive, I'm dead, I'm the stranger
Killing an Arab

            Em
I feel the steel butt jumpff, Smooth in my hand
Staring at the sea, Staring at the sand
Staring at myself, Reflected in the eyes
            Em
Of the dead man on the beach

     Am                       Em
I'm alive, I'm dead, I'm the stranger
Killing an Arab
