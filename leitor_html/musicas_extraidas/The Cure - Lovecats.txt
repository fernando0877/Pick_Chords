Lovecats
The Cure

   Am                   G      F                     G
We move like cagey tigers, we couldn't get closer than this
The way we walk, the way we talk, the way we stalk, the way we kiss
We slip through the streets while everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker and wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night
Let's go and throw all the songs we know
C                             Dm
Into the sea, you and me, all these years and no one heard
      C
I'll show you in spring it's a treacherous thing
    Dm                   Am
We missed you hissed the lovecats

We're so wonderfully wonderfully 
wonderfully wonderfully pretty
Oh you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to tea huh? 
We should have each other with cream
Then curl up in the fire and sleep for a while
It's the grooviest thing, it's the perfect dream (Refr√£o)

 Em                                 
Hand in hand is the only way to land
    F
and always the right way round
 Em
Not broken in pieces like hated little meeces
 F                                    Am
How could we miss someone as dumb as this?
