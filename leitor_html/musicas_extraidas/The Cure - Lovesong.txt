The Cure

Am          G              F     Em
   Whenever I'm alone with you
   You make me feel like I am HOME again
   Whenever I'm alone with you
   You make me feel like I am WHOLE again

   Whenever I'm alone with you
   You make me feel like I am YOUNG again
   Whenever I'm alone with you
   You make me feel like I am FUN again

F          G       Am         C
   However far away, I will always love you
   However long I stay, I will always love you
   Whatever words I say, I will always love you
   I will always love you

   Whenever I'm alone with you
   You make me feel like I am FREE again
   Whenever I'm alone with you
   You make me feel like I am CLEAN again
