Lullaby
The Cure

    C#m
On candystripe legs, spiderman comes,
A
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun.
 C#m
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead,
 A
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
 C#m
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom,
     A
And suddenly, A movement in the corner of the room!
             C#m
And there is nothing I can do when, I realise with fright
          A
That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

 C#m
Quietly he laughs, and shaking his head
       A
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed,
    C#m
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies,
    A
His arms are all around me, and his tongue in my eyes
    C#m
Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy,
         A
Don't struggle like that, or I will only love you more,
         C#m
For it's much too late to get away, or turn on the light;
      A
The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

      F#m
And I feel like I'm being eaten
                                      A
By a thousand million shivering furry holes,
      F#m
And I know that in the morning
                                  A
I will wake up in the shivering cold
                            C#m
And the spiderman is always hungry
