Piggy in the mirror 
The Cure

F                        E
Shapes in the drink like Christ
F                       E
Cracks in the pale blue wall
            F                       E
I'm walking slowly and quickly, but always away
    F                         E
I’m twisting, twisting to the floor, oh

C                             Am
Flowers in your mouth and the same dry song
    C                           Am
The routine from laughter land
C                        Am
Sixteen white legs and a row of teeth
  G
I watch you in secrecy

       F             E
You’re dying for the hope is gone
     F                     E
From here we go nowhere again
       F                          E
Oh I'm trapped in my face and I'm changing too much
        F                        E
I can't climb out the way I fell in, oh

C                            Am
Jump with me For that old forgotten dance
    C                          Am
The midnight sun will burn you up
         C                  Am
And your life is cold, your life is hot
     G
Your life is too much for words

C                 Am
These occasions are such a relief
  C                              Am
Another point, another view to send

Hey hey hey
C                        Am
We start to talk and it’s, and it’s all so sane
G
Oh I feed you in my dreams

F                   E
Footsteps on a wire high above my head
    F                        E
The stain reveals the real intention
        F                      E
I'm the waiting beast, I'm the twisted nerve
F
As I dance, dance back
E
To the body in my bed
F
As I dance, dance back
E
To the body in my bed
F                 E
To the body in my bed
