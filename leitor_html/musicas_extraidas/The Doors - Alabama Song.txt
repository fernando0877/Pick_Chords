Alabama Song
The Doors



      Am
Well, show me the way, To the next, whiskey bar
F#m            D7  F#m            D7
Oh, don't ask why, Oh, don't ask why (2x)


Am
For if we don't find, The next whiskey bar
F#m                D7
I tell you we must die
F#m                D7
I tell you we must die

F#m                   
I tell you, I tell you 
                   C7 
I tell you we must die

     F                                    B7
Oh, moon of Alabama, We now must say goodbye
      G                 Gm6
We've lost our good old mama
C              C7                    F
 And must have whiskey, oh, you know why (2x)
