Hello I love you
The Doors

A          G                  C           A
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name? 
A          G               C           A
Hello, I love you ,let me jump in your game (2x)

      A       G        C  A
She's walking down the street,
      A       G        C  A
blind to every eye she meets 
         A          G       C
Do you think you'll be the guy,
    A       G            C      A
to make the queen of the angels sigh? 

A          G                  C           A
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name? 
A          G               C           A
Hello, I love you ,let me jump in your game (2x)

      A        G       C  A   
She holds her head so high,
       A      G      C A
like a statue in the sky 
      A        G              C         A 
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long 
          A         G            C         A
When she moves my brain screams out this song 

            A#    G#      C# A#
Sidewalk crouches at her feet,
       A#       G#        C#        A#
like a dog that begs for something sweet 
        A#      G#       C#        A#
Do you hope to make her see, you fool? 
        A#       G#          C#   A#
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel? 


Hello, Hello, Hello, 
Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello 
I want you,  Hello!  
I need my baby,   
Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello
