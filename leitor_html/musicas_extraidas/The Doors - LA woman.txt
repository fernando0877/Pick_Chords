LA woman
The Doors

        A7
Well I, just got into town, about an hour ago
A7
Took a look around, see which way, the wind blow
A7                               /
Where the little girls, in their holly-wood, bungalows?
          A7                        /
Are you a lucky little lady, in the city of light?

          A7                        G              A
Or just another lost angel, City of night, City of night
        G              A     (solo)
City of night, City of night

LA woman, LA woman

      A7                              G                A
Drive through your suburbs, Into your blues, Into your blues
          G                A    (troca de tempo divide em 2|2)
Into your blues, Into your blues

  A         G       A     G  A          G           A
I see, your hair is burnin,. Hills, are filled, with fire
        A     G       A       G  A          G     A
If they say,  I never loved you, You know, they are a liar

A       G         A         A         G      A
Drivin, down your freeways, Midnight, alleys roam
A                 A7
Cops in cars, the topless bars
A                      G         A    G         A
Never saw a woman, So alone, so alone, So alone, so alone

A7
Motel money, murder madness
