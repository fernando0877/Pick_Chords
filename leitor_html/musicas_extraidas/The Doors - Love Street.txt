She lives on, Love Street, Lingers long on Love Street
She has, a house and garden, I would like to see what happens

Am                 G
She has robes, and she has monkeys,
Gm            F
lazy diamond, studded funkies

Gm      Am          Bb            F
She has wisdom and, knows what to do,
Gm      F      Bb      A7
she has me and she has you

Bm  A  Am  G (2x)

Am      Bm          C              G
She has wisdom, and knows, what to do,
Am      G       C  G     A7
she has me, and she, has you

Am                 G         Gm                             F
I see you live on, Love Street.. there's a store, where the creatures meet
I wonder, what they do, in there... summer sunday, and a year
I guess I like it fine,  so far

Gm   F
