Capo I
           Em           Bm
Before you slip into, unconscious-ness, 
    Am            F
I'd like to have another kiss
 E      A        B      A      E
Another flashing chaaaaance at bliss,
 D      E      D      E
another kiss, another kiss 

C G D  B

    Em                   Bm
The days are bright, and filled with pain, 
  Am               F
enclose me in your gentle rain 
    E         A       B      A   E
The time you, ran was toooooo insane, 
      D     E           D     E    Em  D  Em  D
we'll meet again, we'll meet again 

C G D  B

    Em                  Bm
Oh, tell me where, your freedom lies, 
    Am                       F
the streets are fields, that never die 
 E      A          B   A      E
Deliver, me from, reeeeeasons why, 
      D      E        D      E
you'd rather cry, I'd rather fly 

    Em              Bm
The crystal ship, is being filled 
  Am                F
A thousand girls, a thousand thrills
  E      A         B     A    E
A million ways, to spend your time
     D      E          D      E
When we get back, I'll drop a line
