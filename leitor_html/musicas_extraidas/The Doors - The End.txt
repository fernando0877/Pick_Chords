Beautiful friend

This is the end
C       D
My only friend, the end
   C    G        D
Of our elaborate plans, the end
   C    G          D
Of everything that stands, the end
   C      G     D
No safety or surprise, the end
     C     G               D
I’ll never look into your  eyes...again

        C                 D
Can you picture what will be
   G7            D
So limitless and free
C              D                G         D
Desperately in need...of some...strangers hand
       C         D
In a...desperate land

D                   C             D
Lost in a romance...wilderness of pain
            C              D
And all the children are insane
                 C     D
All the children are insane
                C            D           
Waiting for the summer rain, yeah

        D
There’s danger on the edge of town

Ride the kings highway, baby

Weird scenes inside the gold mine

Ride the highway west, baby


Ride the snake, ride the snake

To the lake, the ancient lake, baby

The snake is long, seven miles

Ride the snake...he’s old, and his skin is cold

    D
The west is the best

The west is the best

Get here, and we’ll do the rest

D        C              D
The blue bus is calling us
D        C              D
The blue bus is calling us
D                    C     D
Driver, where you’ve taken us


(spoken) D

The killer awoke before dawn, he put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived, and...then he
Paid a visit to his brother, and then he
He walked on down the hall, and
And he came to a door...and he looked inside
Father, yes son, I want to kill you
Mother...I want to...fuck you

D
C’mon baby, take a chance with us

C’mon baby, take a chance with us

C’mon baby, take a chance with us
                               C    D
And meet me at the back of the blue bus
        C    D
Doing a blue rock
     C    D
On a blue bus
        C    D
Doing a blue rock
C      D
C’mon, yeah


Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill

Beautiful friend

My only friend, the end
   C        G       D
It hurts to set you free
                 C      D
But you’ll never follow me
           C            D
The end of laughter and soft lies
           C         G        D
The end of nights we tried to die
C    G      D
This is the end
