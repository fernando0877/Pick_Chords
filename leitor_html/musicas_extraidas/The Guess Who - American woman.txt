American woman, stay away from me
American woman, momma let me be

Don't come a hangin' around my door, 
I don't wanna see, your face no more

I got more important, things to do, 
than spend my time, growin' old with you.

Now woman, I said stay away
American woman, listen what I  saaaaaay

solo:

American woman, get away from me
American woman, momma let me be

Don't come a hangin' around my door, 
I don't wanna see, your shadow no more

Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone elses eyes

Now woman, I said get away
American woman, listen what I  saaaaaay

solo:

American woman, stay away from me
American woman, momma let me be

Dont come a hangin' around my door, 
I dont wanna see, your face no more

I dont need your war machines
I dont need your ghetto scenes

Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone elses eyes

Now woman, I said get away
American woman, listen what I  saaaaaay

Im gotta leave you woman
