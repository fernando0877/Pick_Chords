Now, she went away, and left
        E7                        B7  E  Em  B7  F#7
I'm as alone, some as, a fool can be


Me and my lying self
Said I wouldn't, love no more
Me and my lying self
Said I wouldn't, love no more

Now that woman, took my heart
Ad she walked, right, out the door

solo:

Me and my helpless self
Guess, theres, nothing I can do
Me and my helpless eslf
Well, theres, nothing I can do

Now, she went away, and left
Crying, my heart, over you
