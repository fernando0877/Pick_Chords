Somebody told me
The Killers

Am 
Breaking my back just to know your name,
                                           Dm       F
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game.
Am          
I'm breaking my back just to know your name,
                                        
But heaven ain't close in a place like this,
                                         Dm        F
Anything goes but don't blink, you might miss.
Am
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this,
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this

F                   G                  Am    
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight,
F                                    G            
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight.

               Am
Well, somebody told me,
           F
You had a boyfriend,
                   G
Who looked like a girlfriend.
               E            Am
That I had in February of last year,
          F
It's not confidential,
         G          E
I've got potential
              E
A rushin', a rushin' around.

Am 
Ready? Let's roll onto something new,
                                        Dm     F
Taking it's toll and I'm leaving without you.
Am
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this,
                                              
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this

Am        G       F
Pace yourself for me,
       Am    Dm   F
I said maybe baby please.
                 Am   G    F
But I just don't know now,
   E                        G
When all I wanna do is try.
