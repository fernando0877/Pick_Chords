Waterloo Sunset
The Kinks

A             E                    B7
  Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
           A
Flowing into the night
          E                   B7
People so busy, makes me feel dizzy
           A
Taxi light shines so bright.

      F#m
But I don't need no friends
             E                   B
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
        A
I am in paradise.

A    E  F#                                     B
(Sha-la-la) Every day I look at the world from window
A    E  F#
(Sha-la-la) But chilly, chilly is the evening time,
B
Waterloo sunset's fine

            E               B7
Terry meets Julie, Waterloo station
       A
Every friday night
            E                   B7
But I am so lazy, don't want to wander
          A
I stay at home at night

      F#m
But I don't feel afraid
             E                   B
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
        A
I am in paradise.

A    E  F#                                     B
(Sha-la-la) Every day I look at the world from window
A    E  F#
(Sha-la-la) But chilly, chilly is the evening time,
B
Waterloo sunset's fine

             E                     B7                 A
Millions of people swarming like flies round Waterloo Underground,
               E                     B7
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
                 A
Where they feel safe and sound

         F#m
And they don't need no friends
                E                B
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset
             A
They are in paradise
