Bad Habit
The OffSpring

Hey, man, you know, I'm really okay
A 
The gun in my hand, will tell you the same
         G                    G
But when I'm in my car, don't give me no crap
           E                      E                 A 
’Cause the slightest thing, and I just might snap

A                                     A  C  D  C  A  G  A  C  A 
When I go driving, I stay in my lane
A                                         A  C  D  C  A  G  A  C  A 
But getting cut off, it makes me insane
  G                    G
I open, the glove box, reach inside
          E                     E
I'm gonna wreck, this fucker's, ride I guess I got, 

      A   E  F,  C  D,   E            A   E  F,  C  D,   E

They say the road, is a dangerous place
A                                
If you flip me off, I'll get in your face
        G 
If you drive on my ass, your foot's on the gas
         E                         A 
And your next breath is your last

Drivers are rude, Such attitudes
But when I show my piece, Complaints cease
Something's odd, I feel like I'm God
You stupid dumbshit, goddam motherfucker!
