When we were young the future was so bright
                                  C
The old neighborhood was so alive
                                      G
And every kid on the whole damn street

Was gonna make it big and not be beat

Am                                     F
Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn
                                                C
The kids are grown up but their lives are worn
                          G
How can one little street

Swallow so many lives

        Am
Chances thrown
        F
Nothing's free
        C                G
Longing for what used to be
           Am
Still it's hard
        F
Hard to see
        C.               G
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
( Am  F  C  G )

Jamie had a chance, well she really did
                                                  C
Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids
                                              G
Mark still lives at home cause he's got no job

He just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot

Am                    F
Jay committed suicide
                      C
Brandon OD'd and died
                          G
What the hell is going on

The cruelest dream, reality
