Though I've tried before to tell her
       Am7        /B
of the feelings I have for her
      Am7/F  /G
in my heart            

     Am7/F       /G
Everytime that I come near her
       Am7            /B
I just loose my nerves as I've done

from the start                  

             G                 C
Every little thing she does is magic
             G                   C
Every little thing just turns me on
               G                C
Even though my love before was tragic
              G                 G#7+
now I know my love for her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
of a thousand rainy days 
since we first met

It's a big enough umbrella 
but it's always me who ends up
getting wet  , Refr√£o

Am7  D/C   Am7/F  Am7/F
I resolved to call her up, a thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me

Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone
