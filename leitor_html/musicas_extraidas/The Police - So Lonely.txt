C      G               Am    F
  Well someone told me yesterday
C      G                   Am    F
  That when you throw your love away
C     G             Am         F
  You act as if you just don't care
C     G                 Am        F
  You look as if you're going somewhere

C     G               Am       F
  But I just can't convince myself
C     G                Am     F
  I couldn't live with no one else
C      G               Am    F
  And I can only play that part
C      G               Am    F
  And sit and nurse my broken heart

C           G         Am          F
  So lonely, So lonely, So lonely,
C           G         Am          F
  So lonely, So lonely, So lonely,
C           G         Am          F
  So lonely, So lonely,

C      G               Am    F
  Now no one's knocked upon my door
C      G               Am    F
  For a thousand years or more
C      G               Am    F
  All made up and nowhere to go
C      G               Am    F
  Welcome to this one man show

C      G               Am    F
  Just take a seat they're always free
C      G               Am    F
  No surprise no mystery
C      G               Am    F
  In this theatre that I call my soul
C      G               Am    F
  I always play the starring role

       C           G         Am          F
         So lonely, So lonely, So lonely, So lonely,
C           G         Am          F
  So lonely, So lonely, So lonely,
C           G         Am          F
  So lonely, So lonely, So lonely,
C           G         Am          F
  So lonely, So lonely,      (guitarra solo)

D           A         Bm         G
  So lonely, So lonely, So lonely, So lonely,
D           A         Bm         G
  So lonely, So lonely, So lonely,
