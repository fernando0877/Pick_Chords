Walking On The Moon
The Police

     Bb          F            C               Gm

Dm                            C
Giant steps are what you take, walking on the moon
I hope my legs don't break, walking on the moon
We could walk forever, walking on the moon
We could be together, walking on, walking on the moon

Walking back from your house, walking on the moon
Walking back from your house, walking on the moon
Feet they hardly touch the ground,  walking on the moon
My feet don't hardly make no sound, walking on, walking on the moon

Bb        F   C               Gm   Bb
Some, may say, I'm wishing my days away
   F   C                Gm      Bb
No way, and if it's the price I pay
     F  C              Gm     Bb 
Some say, tomorrow is another day
     F      C          
You stay, I may as well play
