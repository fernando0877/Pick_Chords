Dont get me wrong
The Pretenders

C   Am   F   G
             C
Don't get me wrong
                       Am
If I'm looking kind of dazzled
      F
I see neon lights
                  G7
Whenever you walk by

             C
Don't get me wrong
                     Am
If you say hello and I take a ride
                     F
Upon a sea where the mystic moon
                 G
Is playing havoc with the tide
             C        Am    F    G
Don't get me wrong

             C
Don't get me wrong
                    Am
If I'm acting so distracted
                       F
I'm thinking about the fireworks
                     G
That go off when you smile

             C
Don't get me wrong
                        Am
If I split like light refracted
                F       G
I'm only off to wander
                 C
Across a moonlit mile

Dm              G
Once in a while
Dm              G
Two people meet
Dm               G
Seemingly for no reason
          Dm                 G
They just pass on the street
Dm         G      Dm                 G
Suddenly thunder, showers everywhere

Who can explain the thunder and rain
                              C    Am    F    G
But there's something in the air

             C
Don't get me wrong
                      Am
If I come and go like fashion
                   F
I might be great tomorrow
                   G
But hopeless yesterday


             C
Don't get me wrong
                         Am
If I fall in the mode of passion
                F         G
It might be unbelievable
                     Am
But let's not say so long
                    F      G
It might just be fantastic
             Am
Don't get me wrong
