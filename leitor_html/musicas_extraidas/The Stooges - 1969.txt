1969
The Stooges

(A G)
It's 1969 okay
all across the usa
it's another year for me and you
Another year with nothing to do
It's another year for me and you
Another year with nothing to do

(A G A G AG)
In a last year I was 21
I didn't have a lot of fun
And now i'm gonna be 22
I say oh my and a boohoo
And now i'm gonna be 22
I say oh my and a boo-hoo

(D C)
It's 1969 okay
all across the usa
it's another year for me and you
Another year with nothing to do
It's another year for me and you
Another year with nothing to do
