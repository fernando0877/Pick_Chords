Someday
The Strokes

A                     Bm7
In many ways, They'll miss the good old days
D        A
Someday, someday
          A                  Bm7
Yeah, it hurts to say, But I want you to stay
D          A
Sometimes, sometimes

     A                 Bm7
When we was young, Oh, man, did we have fun
D        A
Always, always
A              Bm7
Promises, They break before they're made
D          A
Sometimes, sometimes

    A              E7           F#m
Oh  Maya, says I'm lacking in depth
D             A
 I will do my best
    A                E7        F#m
You say you want to stay by my side
D                        A
Darling, your head's not right

      A                E7               F#m
I see alone we stand, together we fall apart
      D                 A
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
    A             E7          F#m
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
D                    A                 E
Tables they turn sometimes.... Oh, someday

E
Now I ain't wasting no more time

     A                        Bm7
And now my fears, They come to me in threes
D      A
So I  sometimes

      A                   Bm7
Say fate my friend, You say the strangest things
D       A
I find sometimes
