Behind Blue eyes
The Who

Em                     G6
No one knows what it's like 
          D9                  C9   
To be the bad man , To be the sad man 
  A9   
Behind blue eyes

    Em                     G6
And no one knows what it's like 
      D9           C9   
To be hated, To be fated 
           A9   
To telling only lies 

       C9     D               G
But my dreams, They aren't as empty 
      C9         D         E   E4   
As my conscience seems, to be
       Bm          C9   
I have hours, only lonely 
           D                       A9   
My love is vengeance, That's never free 

Em                     G6
No one knows what it's like 
              D9               C9   
To feel these feelin's, Like I do 
            A9
And I blame you

   Em                G6
No one bites back as hard 
         D9                     C9    
On their anger, None of my pain an' woe 
         A9   
Can show through, (Refrão)

Em                     G6
No one knows what it's like 
         D9               C9   
To be mistreated, To be defeated 
  A9   
Behind blue eyes

    Em                  G6
And no one knows how to say
             D9               C9   
That they're sorry, An' don't worry 
        A9          (:refrão / 1a estrofe)
I'm not telling lies
