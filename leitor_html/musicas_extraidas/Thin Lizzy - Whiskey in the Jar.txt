riff:
   G                     Em
As I was goin' over, the Cork and Kerry mountains
  C                           G
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was countin
  G                            Em
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
       C                        G
I said stand and deliver or the devil he may take ya

      D
Musha ring, dum a doo, dum a da
C                     C
Whack for my daddy-o, Whack for my daddy-o
        G              | G     G F |
There's whiskey in the jar-o
riff:

G                              Em
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
  C                           G
I took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly
                              Em
She swore that she'd love me, never would she leave me
        C                             G
But the devil take that woman for you know she tricked me easy

riff:

G                       Em
Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
C                            G
Takin my money with me and I never knew the danger
                             Em
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
         C                              G
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels
Chorus:

    G                             Em
Now some men like the fishin' and some men like the fowlin'
    C                           G
And some men like to hear   the cannon ball a roarin'
                   Em
Me I like sleepin' specially in my Molly's chamber
    C                           G
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah
