Give Me One Reason
Tracy Chapman

F#                               
  Give me one reason to stay here
B          C#7              F#         
  And I'll turn right back around
  B
  Give me one reason to stay here
           C#               F#
  And I'll turn right back around
         C#7 
  Said I don't want leave you lonely
B                              F#
  You got to make me change my mind

Baby I got your number, and I know that you got mine
You know that I called you, I called too many times
You can call me baby, you call me anytime

I don't want no one to squeeze me
they might take away my life
I don't want no one to squeeze me
they might take away my life
I just want someone to hold me 
and rock me through the night

This youthful heart can love 
you and give you what you need
This youthful heart can love you 
and give you what you need
But I'm too old to go chasing you around
Wasting my precious energy

Baby just give me one reason, 
Give me just one reason why
Baby just give me one reason, 
Give me just one reason why 
Said I told you that I loved you
And There ain't no more say
