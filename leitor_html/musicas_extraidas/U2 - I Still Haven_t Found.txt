I Still Haven't Found
U2

       G                   G6
I have climbed, the highest mountains
       G               G6
I have run, through the fields,
        C                    G
Only to be with you, Only to be with you

I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled, these city walls, 
these city walls, Only to be with you

        D7          C
But I still haven't found
                  G
What I'm looking for  (2x)

I have kissed, honey lips
Felt the healing, fingertips
in burned like fire, This burning desire

I have spoke, tongue of angels
I have held, hand of devil
It was warm in the night, I was cold as stone

I believe, in a kindom come, 
All the color will, Bleed into one uhhh
I believe it
