I was on the outside when you said
                   A       E
You said you needed me     
                    A
I was looking on at myself
      E                  A
I was blind, I could not see

E                       A
A boy tries hard to be a man
E                    A
His mother takes him by his hand
      E               A                     E      A
If he stops to think, he starts to cry, Oh, why?

          E
If you walk away, walk away
A                       E
I walk away, walk away  
       A
I will follow (2x)

E            A
I was on the inside
          E                     A
When they pulled the four walls down
E                         A
I was looking through the window
      E          A
I was lost, I am found

Your      eyes make a circle

I see you when I come in here

It's your eyes, it's your eyes 
    B  D  Em      Bm  D           E   C   E   A    D
Your eyes,    your, your eyes

I will follow, I will, I will
