Am       C        Em
  All is quiet on New Year's Day
Am           C           Em
  A world in white, gets underway
Am          C                        Em
  I want to be with you, be with you night and day
Am        C          Em          Am  C
  Nothing changes on New Year's Day
    Em
 On New Year's Day

G              Am
  I will be with you again
G                F       Am   C   Em
  I will be with you again

Am     C            Em
  Under a blood red sky
Am            C           Em
  A crowd has gathered in black and white
Am       C           Em
  Arms entwined, the chosen few
Am          C   Em    
  Newspaper say, says, 

         G
say it's true, it's true
    Am
And we can break through
       G                   F
Though torn in two, we can be one

G            Am
 I, I will begin again
G            F    Am     C  Em  Am 
 I, I will begin again,
