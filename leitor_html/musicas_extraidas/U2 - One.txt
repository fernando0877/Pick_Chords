Am                    D
   Is it getting better
F                     G
  Or do you feel the same
Am                  D
   Will it make it, easier on you, now
F                    G
  you got someone to blame

       C         Am
You say, one love, one life
F                   C
  When it's one need, in the night
C         Am
  One love, we get to share it,
F
  It leaves you baby if you
C                   Am    D    F    G
  don't care for it

Am            D
   Did I disappoint you?
F                       G
  Or leave a bad taste, in your mouth?
Am     /                  D
   You act like you never had love
F                           G
  And you want me, to go without (Well it's)

C        Am
 too late, tonight
F                        C
  To drag the past out in-to the light
C                     Am
  We're one, but we're not the same
         F                     C              Am    D    F    G          
We get to carry  each other, carry each other One

Am          /                 D
   Have you come here, for forgiveness
F          /              G
  Have you come to raise, the dead
Am                             D
   Have you come here, to play Jesus
F                        G
  To the lepers, in your head

C                   Am
 Did I ask too much,  More than a lot
F                              C
 You gave me nothing Now, it's all I got
C                      Am
  We're one, but we're not the same
        F                         C
Well we, hurt each other, then we do it again (You say)

C                 Am
Love is a temple, love's a higher law
C                 Am
Love is a temple, love's a higher law
    C                    G
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
    G                  F
And I can't be holding on
               F                      C
To what you got, when all you got is hurt

C         Am
  One love, One blood
F                       C
  One life, you got, to do what you should
C         Am
  One life, with each other
F         C
  Sisters, brothers

C                     Am
  One life (but we're) not the same
             F                C
(We get) to carry each other, carry each other
 C     Am     F     C
One,         One
