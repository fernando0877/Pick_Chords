Pride (In The Name Of Love)
U2

B                   E
One man come in the name of love,
A               F#m
One man come and go
B                  E
One man come he to justify,
 A               F#m
One man to overthrow,

       B       E
In the name of love,
 A               F#m
What more in the name of love?

 B                    E
One man crawled on a barbed wire fence,
 A           F#m
One man he resist
 B                    E
One man washed on an empty beach
 A                      F#m
One man betrayed with a kiss
 B  E  A  F#m
Ooo-oo-oo-oo

 B             E
Early morning, April 4
  A                     F#m
A shot rings out in the Memphis sky
B                  E
Free at last, they took your life,
     A                   F#m
They could not take your pride
