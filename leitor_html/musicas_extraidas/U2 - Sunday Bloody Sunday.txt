Sunday Bloody Sunday
U2

tom orig Bbm, n√£o fazer em Bm,muito alto

Bm         D               G
 I can't believe in news today
Bm       D               G
 I can't close my eyes and make it go away

D          Em
 How long, how long must we sing this song?
D              Em
 How long, how long?
  Bm  D     G                    Bm  D     G
Toniiiiiight we can be as one, toniiiight

Bm        D           G 
 Broken bottles under children's feet
Bm        D              G 
 And body strewn across a dead end street
Bm            D               G
 But I won't heed the battle call
Bm           D                G
 It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall

Bm   D          G
 Sunday, bloody Sunday (4x)

B         D             G 
 And the battles just begun
Bm            D             G
 There's many lost, tell me who has won?
Bm            D              G
 The trenches dug within our hearts
Bm            D                                 G
 And mother's children, brothers, sisters torn apart

Bm   D          G
 Sunday, bloody Sunday (4x)

D          Em
 How long, how long must we sing this song?
D              Em
 How long, how long?

  Bm  D     G                    Bm  D     G
Toniiiiiight we can be as one, toniiiight

          Bm    D   G
Wipe your tears away (4x)

Bm         D            G 
 And it is true we are immune
Bm            D                G 
 When fact is fiction, TV reality
Bm     D               G 
 And today the millions cry
Bm          D             G 
 We eat and drink while tomorrow they die
Bm        D             G 
 The real battle just begun
Bm        D             G 
 To claim victory Jesus won
