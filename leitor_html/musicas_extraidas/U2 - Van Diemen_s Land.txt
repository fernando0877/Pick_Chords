Van Diemen's Land
U2

(tom orig F#, CAPO 1, forma E)
G D G C G
        G   C             G  
Hold me now, ohh hold me now
G         Em   C          D 
Till this hour   has gone around
        Bm                 Em
And I'm gone, on the rising tide
C        G    D              G  
  for to face   Van Diemen's Land

              G    C           G  
ItÂ´s a bitter pill , I swallow here
G       Em   C            D   
To be a rent, from one so dear
              Bm                  Em
we fought for justice and not for gain
C              G    D          G
  But the magistrate,  sent me away

               G    C                    G 
Now Kings will rule,   and the poor will toil
    G           Em    C                  D 
And tear their  hands   as they tear the soil
               Bm                   Em
But a day will come, in the downing age
C                G   D           G
  When an honest man   an honest wage
