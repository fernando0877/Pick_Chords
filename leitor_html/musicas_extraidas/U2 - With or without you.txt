With or without you
U2

G D Em C (Capo7th Fret)
G         D                 Em
 See the stone set in your eyes         
         C                   G
See the thorn twist in your side
          D       Em    C
And I'll wait for you

G            D                Em
 Sleight of hand and twist of fate
             C                   G
On a bed of nails, she makes me wait
          D        Em      C
And I'll wait, without you 
             G    D              Em     C 
With or without you, with or without you

G             D                  Em
 Through the storm we reach the shore
             C              G
You give it all but I want more
          D      Em     C
And I'm waiting for you

            G      D         Em           C
With or without you, with or without you I
         G   D             Em     C
I can't live   with or without you

         G             D            Em            C
And you give yourself away, And you give yourself away(2x)

G              D
 My hands are tied, 
Em        C                     G
 my body bruised, she's got me with
            D        Em              C
nothing to win, and nothing left to lose

         G             D            Em            C
And you give yourself away, And you give yourself away(2x)

            G      D         Em           C
With or without you, with or without you I
         G   D             Em     C
I can't live   with or without you
