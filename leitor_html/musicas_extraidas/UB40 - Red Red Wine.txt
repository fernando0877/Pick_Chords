 Red, red wiiiine,  goes to my head,
 Makes me forget that I
 Still need her so
 Red, red wine, it's up to you
 All I can do, I've done
 Memories won't go
 Memories won't go

I'd have thought that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget

Red, red wine, stay close to me
Don't let me be alone, It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart
