A child arrived just the other day
A9                         E
Came to the world in the usual way
           E5               G
There were planes to catch, bills to pay
    A9                     E
He learned to walk while i was away
       D        /C#         Bm             /A
He was talking 'fore i knew it and when he could,
         G                  E
he said "I'm gonna be like you, dad
    G                       E
You know i'm gonna be like you"

    E                           D
The cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
 G                     A
Little boy blue and a man on the moon
E                         D
When you comin' home son, i don't know when
G                    A
We'll get together then
G                                E
You know we'll have a good time then

E5                         G
My son turned ten just the other day
A9                                     E
He said "thanks for the ball dad, come on, let's play
E5                                       G
Could you teach me to throw?", i said "not today
A                             E
I got a lot to do", he said "that's ok"
D                                        G
He walked away with a smile on his face, he said
               E
"I'm gonna be like him, yeah
G                           E
You know i'm gonna be like him"

I've long since retired, my son moved away
A9                  E
I called him up just the other day
E5                     G
I'd like to see you, if you don't mind
 A9                          E
He said: i'd love to, dad, if i could find the time
         D
You see, my new job's hassle and the kids got the flu
 G                             E
But it's sure nice talking to you dad
G                     E
It was sure nice talking to you.

       D
And as i hung up the phone is occurred to me
 G                      E
He'd grown up just like me
G                     E
My boy was just like me!
