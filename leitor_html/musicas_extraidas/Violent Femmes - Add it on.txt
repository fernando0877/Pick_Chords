Day after day, I will walk, and I will play
        Bm                        A               Bm
But the day after today, I will stop and I will start

Why can't I get just one kiss?  Why can't I get just one kiss?
  A                                                Bm
Believe me, some things that I wouldn't miss but I look at your pants and I need a kiss.
Bm
Why can't I get just one screw?  Why can't I get just one screw?

Believe me, I'd know what to do, but something won't let me make love to you.

I guess it's got something to do with luck but I waited my whole life for just one

Day after day
      A                 Bm
I get angry, and I will say.
         Bm
That the day is in my sights
              A                 Bm
When I take a bow, and say good night.

Oh my, mama, mama, mo my mum, have you kept your eye, your eye on your son?
A                                                      Bm
You know you've had problems, you're not the only one, when your sugar left, he left you on the run.

Oh my, mama, mama, mo my mum, take a look now at what your boy has done.
Bm                                        A
He's walking around like he's number one, he went downtown and he got on the gun.

So don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me. Don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me.
A                                         Bm

There's a broken down kitchen at the top of the stairs kinda mixed in with your affairs.
A                           Bm
Share a smoke, make a joke, grasp and reach for a leg of hope.
Bm
Words to memorize, words hypnotize, words make my mouth exercise.
A                               Bm
Words all fail the magic prize, nothing I can say when I'm in your thighs
Bm
Say oh my, mama, mama, mo my mother, I would love to love you, lover.
A                                          Bm
The city's restless, it's ready to pounce, going here in your bedroom ounce for ounce.
