Kiss Off
Violent Femmes

Em 
I need someone, a person to talk to
Someone who'd care to love
            C                Em
Could it be you, Could it be you
Em
Situation gets rough, Then I start to panic
It's not enough, It's just a habit
        C                            Em
Hey kid you're sick, Darling this is it

C                D5/F#
You can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad but I won't mind

They'll hurt me bad they do it all the time
Yeah yeah, they do it all the time

Em
I hope you know that this will go down on your permanent record
                          C
Oh yeah well don't get so distressed
                                 Em
Did I happen to mention that I'm impressed

I take 1 1 one 'cause you left me
And 2 2 2 for my family
And 3 3 3 for my heartache
And 4 4 4 for my headaches
  Em
And 5 5 5 for my lonely
And 6 6 6 for my sorrow
And 7 7 7 for no tomorrow
And 8 8 8 I forget what 8 was for
And 9 9 9 for a lost god
And 10 10 10 for everything everything everything everything
