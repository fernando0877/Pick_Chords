 The fundamental problem,
C7+           Am
 I'll need to face
G7+           Em          Am
 This is important, But I know

Am
 With no larger problems, 
C7+
 That need to be erased
G7+                Em                Am
And nothing more important, Than to know

someone's listening to me, Oh I know,
          C7+
you'll be listening to me
