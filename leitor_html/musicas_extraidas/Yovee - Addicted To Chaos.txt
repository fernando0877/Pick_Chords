Addicted To Chaos
Yovee

Why was everyone so engulfed?
When all I care about is my morning Big Gulp,
But its in the way that I cant get away,
From the judgment that's forced everyday
So I will look for the tunnel to come,
Instead of the light that it was looking from
Don't get this wrong cause it kills to be right
As I smoke everything in sight,
As I smoke everything in sight.

And we're addicted to chaos
And I'll see you tonight,
Smoking while watch the tune and
In our sights,
And we'll drive and drive and drive and drive and drive,
Through the night
And I'll swoop in on before your endless flight.

If what was thought was really said,
I'd socialize till the day I was dead,
But its in the way that I look in the mirror,
And the guardian that keeps me here,
So I will look for the tunnel to come
Instead of the light that it was looking from
Don't get this wrong cause it kills to be right
As I drink everything in sight
As I drink everything in sight

And we're addicted to chaos,
And I'll see you tonight,
Dun-Dee kingdom is in our sights
And we'll fly and fly and fly and fly and fly,
Through the night,
And I'll swoop in on before your restless flight.
