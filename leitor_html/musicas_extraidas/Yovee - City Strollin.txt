City Strollin
Yovee


City strollin'
and the country's on my back
Now we're leaving
and the city is where its at

Billy dropped the ball
Was walking 'round,
the steepest streets i've ever seen
I think it was Frisco
but we were so fucked up
I think you know what I mean

Forest? strollin'
and the country's on my back
Now we're leaving
and the city's where its at

And then we dropped the ball
we was walking 'round
in the greenest hill i've ever seen
i think it was Bigsa
but were so fucked up
I think you know what I mean

Surprise , just look and walk around the water
be glad it was a dream, only chance
look to those who came and went before you
and i'll see you on your only holiday

If it's crunch time
cause the money's on my back
created strollin'
and the stones are where it's at

Margaritas, tall with salt
we are drinking while you're clockin in
i think it was Frisco
but were so fucked up
i think you know what I mean

Surprise , just look and walk around the water
be glad it was a dream, only chance
look to those who came and went before you
and i'll see you your only holiday
