Dreamer On The Run
Yovee

Gm F Eb Eb / Gm F Eb Cm

So you know you tore, my heart right out for a second time
And I hear you`re hanging around, the favorite watering holes
Then I told everyone, that you was nothing more than a wrecking machine
And I`ll meet you oh-whoa, only you and all your securities

Cm
Good-bye, take it as it comes
           Eb                          F
That`s the common misconception of the dreamer on the run
Decide, if you are alive
And all these visionary people are so bad in your eyes
And get high, taker of the life
Don`t you wonder what`s inside, keeps your drive alive?
Good-bye, I miss you all along
Hope it`s happy, all alone, I`m the smile in your life


So I hear you`re married now, on the outskirts of town to a gambling hand
        Gm                 F                           Eb
And you know this man will never have a poker hand as good as mine
And I think you know now, that I am the one, who`s the wrecking machine
And I`ll meet you oh-whoa, only in, our memories
