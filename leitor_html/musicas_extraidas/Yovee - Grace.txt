Rush down to, touch the water
smiles turn down, where there's no laughter
sweat long waves, by ? river
voice like theirs, an angel singing.
D           Em          G
time stands still while i go faster
riding my emotional rollercoaster
we both know you had to go 
though why so soon? i just wanna know

ride down by
those muddy waters
held hands and
pray together
made laughter
for those above us
wind on cause
we know no better

take some time to make it better
ride into the beat of a different drama
i love these whether you like better
earth, love, life or a spinning river

play the show, radio
getting down, with all your friends
heading down the river side
coming in, all alone

take a dive, hold your breath
summer clothes, see a man
can you swim, against the rip?
can you tire against the air?

time stand stills as i go faster
riding my emotional rollercoaster
we both know you had to go but
why so soon? i just wanna know
