Intimate Controversy
Yovee

Dm               F                Gm
Deceased, that's me, come join the next scene,
The legacy continues in purgatory,
Happy to leave, lonely me
No telephone just roaming your home on and on now.

Its dead necks party to remember
Who could ask for more, everybody
Bodies at the door no invitation,
A party where no ones still alive.

Love me, my thoughts to you and only you,
Cause intimacy comes with only controversy,
I'm sent by you till mornings dew
No telephone just roaming your home on and on.

Its dead necks party to remember
Who could ask for more, everybody
Bodies at the door no invitation,
A party where no one's still alive.
