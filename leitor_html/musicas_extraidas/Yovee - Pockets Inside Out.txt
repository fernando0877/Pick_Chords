Pockets Inside Out
Yovee

Hey, we'll build a room,
We'll paint it blue,
And wait for the day.
If they had a kid it better be a boy,
You'll never understand the way he thinks,
You'll never get it.

Then a girl is born,
It's not his son,
Take her away.
And you'll tell the doc just what we want,
And they'll fix it so we have a boy,
And then they'll get it.

She's not a little girl anymore,
You can't save her now,
She's one step closer to the door.
And he had to have it all his way,
But she's older now,
She's one step closer to the door.

Now she's 21 watch out,
She'll match you shot to shot,
She'll turn your pockets inside out.
Look out, for her mesmerizing kiss
A kiss you'll never get,
Confess
You've heard it like the rest

She's not a little girl anymore (she's not a little girl anymore)
She's one step (one step)
Closer to the door
But he had to have it all his way (had to have it all his way)
She's one step (one step)
Closer to the door.

Now she's 21 watch out (she's 21 watch out)
She'll turn your pockets inside out...
