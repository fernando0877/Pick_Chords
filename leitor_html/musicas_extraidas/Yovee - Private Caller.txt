Private Caller
Yovee

Bm    G
Uh, yeah!

Who's that calling?
2 am, it's private caller
someones mother
who's that peeking,
through my window?

I will shoot you, stuff you and,
put you on my wall of trophies
we will drink red wine and
laugh at
day that you came all
nimbly bimbly and
you busted windows
for the system

Bm        A                  Em
Get ready! This weekend will come undone!
Forget it! Cause we're coming to pass you up!

Uh, yeah! (x2)

Pass you up now and i say
How do you know when to say it's not enough
Now with these drugs, never with this love
we come undone
Come undone now and unfold
