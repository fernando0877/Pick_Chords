Rage In Ruins
Yovee

The rage in ruins and the conference of the days,
We should meet up there,
I heard that you could scream and yell,
It's the perfect atmosphere,
And I hope you truly come,
And all the good go wrong my freedom
Leads me here,
And I think there's more to come...

Dusty river dryness in my eyes,
But I can clearly see it fade away,
Somewhere in the western part of space
We will see it once again,

The rage in ruins and the conference of the days,
We should meet up there,
I heard that you could scream and yell,
It's the perfect atmosphere,
And I hope you truly come,
And all the good go wrong my freedom,
Leads me here,
And I think there's more to come...

Dusty river dryness in my eyes,
But I can clearly see it fade away,
Somewhere in the western part of space
We will see it once again (3x)
