G        C               G
She said,  she'd take me anywhere
C               G
  she'd take me anywhere
C                G     C
  as long as, I stayed clean

G        C               G
She said,  she'd take me anywhere
C               G
  she'd take me anywhere
C                G          C
as long as, she stayed with me
