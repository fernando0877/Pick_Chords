  Is this the real life?  Is this just fantasy?
 D7                        G
Caught in a landslide No escape from reality

Em                  G7                    C
Open your eyes, Look up to the skies and see
Am                     D7
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
            G#   G     F#   G   G#     G     F#     G
Because I'm easy come, easy go, Little high, little low
C          G/B        A#째            D7              G6
Anyway the wind blows,Doesn't really matter to me to me

G6         Em                 Am

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
      G/B       Am        Fm              C
Carry on, carry on, As if nothing really matters

G6            Em                 Am
Too late, my time has come,Sends shivers down my spine
                      D
Body's aching all the time
G6                      Em
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
      Am        Am/G# Am/G     Am/F#         Am/F   Am/E
Gotta leave you all behind And face  the truth

I sometimes wish I'd never been, born at all
